0,Tesla Pullback Puts Onus on Others to Build Electric Vehicle Chargers,"Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla, blindsided competitors, suppliers and his own employees this week by reversing course on his aggressive push to build electric vehicle chargers in the United States, a major priority of the Biden administration.Mr. Musk’s decision to lay off the 500-member team responsible for installing charging stations, and to sharply slow investment in new stations, baffled the industry and raised doubts about whether the number of public chargers would grow fast enough to keep pace with sales of battery-powered cars. It put the onus on other charging companies, raising questions about whether they can build fast enough to address a shortage that appears to be discouraging some people from buying electric cars.As the owner of the largest charging network in the United States, Tesla has a powerful effect on people’s views of electric cars.“There is certainly a psychological component,” said Robert Zabors, a senior partner at Roland Berger, a consulting firm. “Availability and reliability are critical to overall E.V. adoption.”Tesla’s change of direction, only days after it had told shareholders in a securities filing that it would “rapidly” expand its charging network, which it calls Supercharger, is likely to delay construction of fast chargers, which are concentrated along the two coasts and in parts of Texas.Wildflower, a New York real estate developer, was on the verge of signing a lease with Tesla to build a charging center near the intersection of Interstates 278 and 495 in Queens. Then Adam Gordon, the firm’s managing partner, got a text message from the Tesla executive he had been working with.",By Jack Ewing and Ivan Penn,2024-05-04 05:04:41-04:00,business,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/04/business/energy-environment/tesla-electric-vehicles-supercharger.html,The New York Times
1,Billionaire Donor Assails Brown’s ‘Unconscionable’ Deal With Protesters,"One of Brown University’s major donors, the billionaire real estate mogul Barry Sternlicht, on Friday sharply criticized the school’s agreement to hold a board vote on cutting investments tied to Israel, calling it “unconscionable” and saying he had “paused” donations to the school.Brown is among a small number of universities that have agreed to discuss their investments in companies that do business in Israel, in order to persuade student protesters to dismantle encampments. Mr. Sternlicht, in a scathing email to The New York Times, which he copied to Brown’s president, Christina H. Paxson, said the arrangement amounted to sympathy for Hamas, which attacked Israel in October, and described students protesting Israel’s actions in Gaza as “ignorant.”“There should never be a vote when people do not have the facts,” he wrote. “It’s not education, it’s propaganda.”Mr. Sternlicht, 63, said no deal with protesters could be fruitful because the two sides did not agree on “facts and moral clarity,” as well as the scale of Israel’s invasion of Gaza after Hamas’s Oct. 7 attack, in which about 1,200 were killed and another 250 were taken hostage. Israel’s subsequent intense bombardment of the tightly packed area has left more than 34,000 dead and drawn international condemnation.He cited the hundreds of thousands of civilians killed in wars in Ukraine, Syria, Afghanistan, and Iraq, asking: “Where were the protests?”“As far as wars go, Israel has been quite muted,” Mr. Sternlicht wrote.The blowback from Mr. Sternlicht, who has described himself as a political independent and whose name is on a Brown residence hall, shows how quickly the issue of divestment from Israel may vex universities. Until a week ago, even discussing the subject was widely considered a nonstarter, as it was sure to divide a large swath of students and faculty from many of the businesspeople whose donations fill university endowments.",By Rob Copeland,2024-05-03 19:21:00-04:00,business,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/03/business/sterlicht-brown-university-donor.html,The New York Times
2,Berkshire Reports Drop in Profits but Formidable Cash Stockpile,"Berkshire Hathaway on Saturday reported a sharp drop in first-quarter profits, driven largely by lower investment income, as the conglomerate’s chief executive, Warren E. Buffett, prepares to speak at its annual investor meeting.Those results belie an increase in operating earnings, which track the actual profits that Berkshire’s array of companies produce, and in Berkshire’s formidable cash hoard — which totaled nearly $189 billion as of March 31 — that points to the company’s robust health.The company’s latest results set a backdrop for the meeting in downtown Omaha, which will be the first for Berkshire since the death in November of Charles Munger, Mr. Buffett’s longtime business partner and alter ego, at age 99.For the first three months of the year, Berkshire reported $12.7 billion in earnings attributable to its shareholders, down 64 percent from the same time a year ago. Driving the drop was a steep fall in the paper value of Berkshire’s vast investment portfolio though Mr. Buffett has long warned shareholders to ignore fluctuations in the company’s stock holdings.Berkshire also disclosed that it had trimmed its huge stake in Apple, which Mr. Buffett has called one of his company’s most important holdings, by about 13 percent in the quarter. It now owns about $135.4 billion, down from $174.3 billion at the end of 2023. (Apple’s chief executive, Tim Cook, is attending the annual meeting.)Looking at operating earnings, Mr. Buffett’s favored metric because it measures the tangible health of Berkshire’s business, the company reported a 40 percent gain, to $11.2 billion. That was propelled by a more than doubling of Berkshire’s core insurance underwriting business, as its Geico insurer charged higher premiums per policy and reported fewer claims, while its reinsurance division didn’t take any hits from catastrophes in this year’s first quarter.Those gains offset weaker results in other parts of Mr. Buffett’s empire, including an 8 percent fall in net earnings at the BNSF railroad because of lower shipments of fuel versus consumer goods and lower fuel surcharge revenue.Its Pilot Travel Centers chain of truck stops, which it acquired full control of in January, reported a 19 percent drop in net earnings, as the business saw lower margins on fuel sales and higher operating expenses.And Berkshire disclosed that its PacifiCorp utility, which operates in the West, faces federal and state investigations and lawsuits over any role it played in wildfires in 2020 and 2022.The earnings report was released ahead of the Berkshire meeting, which will see tens of thousands of Berkshire shareholders gather at the CHI Health Center arena in the company’s hometown to watch Mr. Buffett answer questions.Among the topics that he will probably discuss — some with the help of his top lieutenants, including his likely successor, Gregory Abel — are his outlook on the economy and the November elections and where he sees investment opportunities.Michael de la Merced joined The Times as a reporter in 2006, covering Wall Street and finance.

3,"Oil Companies Expand Offshore Drilling, Pointing to Energy Needs","About 80 miles southeast of Louisiana’s coast, 100,000 metric tons of steel floats in the Gulf of Mexico, an emblem of the hopes of oil and gas companies.This hulk of metal, a deepwater platform called Appomattox and owned by Shell, collects the oil and gas that rigs tap from reservoirs thousands of feet below the seafloor. Equipment on the platform pipes that fuel to shore.Political and corporate leaders have pledged to reduce planet-warming emissions to net-zero by 2050. But oil companies like Shell are betting that the world will need oil and gas for decades to come. To serve that demand, they are expanding offshore oil and gas drilling into deeper and deeper waters, especially here in the Gulf of Mexico.Offshore production, oil executives argue, is not only crucial to power cars, trucks and power plants but also better for the planet than drilling on land. That’s because such operations emit far less of the greenhouse gases that are warming the planet than producing the same amount of oil and gas on land, according to industry estimates.“The world will continue to need oil, by the way, even in 2050,” Wael Sawan, chief executive of Shell, said in a recent interview. “It will have to be lower and lower emissions.”The greenhouse gas emissions associated with extracting a barrel of oil from the Gulf of Mexico are as much as a third lower than emissions from producing a barrel of oil from fields on U.S. soil, according to a report published last year by the National Ocean Industries Association, an industry group for offshore oil, gas and wind businesses. (Those numbers do not include the emissions created when fossil fuels are burned in engines or power plants, which are much greater than emissions from producing and refining oil and gas.)",By Ivan Penn,2024-05-03 05:00:46-04:00,business,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/03/business/energy-environment/shell-offshore-oil-gulf-of-mexico.html,The New York Times
4,The Perils of the Fed’s Vast Bond Holdings,"The Federal Reserve is engaged in a colossal transformation of the financial economy. Yet scarcely anyone is noticing.What it’s doing is like walking a herd of elephants through Midtown Manhattan without attracting much attention. That used to happen in New York in the wee hours — when the circus came to town and elephants walked over the city’s bridges and through its tunnels to Madison Square Garden.I’m not talking about the Fed’s decisions on short-term interest rates, which get the headlines when the central bank meets, as it did on Wednesday. The Fed kept those rates steady — and fairly high — at about 5.33 percent, in a frustrating battle to subdue inflation.I’m talking about a remarkably ambitious and poorly understood Fed project known as quantitative tightening — Q.T. for short. That refers to the Fed’s reduction of the Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities on its mammoth balance sheet.The central bank said on Wednesday that it would start slowing the pace of this asset paring in June, to $60 billion a month from a maximum reduction of $95 billion a month. It’s not selling securities, just quietly eliminating some as they mature, without reinvesting the proceeds.These may look like big numbers. Yet on a comparative basis, they are piddling.Consider that the central bank’s assets peaked two years ago at almost $9 trillion. That sum is roughly one-third of all the goods and services — the gross domestic product — produced in the United States in one year. Now, after much careful effort, the Fed has cut that total to about $7.4 trillion.",By Jeff Sommer,2024-05-03 09:00:15-04:00,business,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/03/business/federal-reserve-markets-turmoil.html,The New York Times
5,"As Kentucky Derby Nears, Last Year’s Deaths Cast Long Shadow","The Kentucky Derby has been run through two World Wars, the Great Depression, civil rights unrest and, most recently, a life-paralyzing pandemic. Now, on the 150th anniversary of America’s most famous race, the Sport of Kings faces another formidable foe: itself.Last year, beneath Churchill Downs’s iconic twin spires, seven horses died during the week of the showpiece event — two of them in races in the hours leading up to the Derby. In the days after, five more sustained fatal injuries, prompting Churchill officials to move their races to another Kentucky racetrack.It got worse. A colt trained by the sport’s most recognized and controversial trainer, Bob Baffert, died at Pimlico Race Course hours before Mr. Baffert saddled the winner of the Preakness Stakes, the second leg of the Triple Crown. Two more horses not trained by Mr. Baffert died in races surrounding the Belmont Stakes, the third leg, in June.At the historic Saratoga Race Course in New York, 13 horses died while racing and training at the sport’s signature summer meet, including two who seemed poised to win their races before breaking down near the finish line on nationally televised broadcasts.Over the past 12 months, The New York Times analyzed confidential documents and covert recordings made by law enforcement, and obtained exclusive interviews as part of an investigation into why so many horses, supposedly in peak physical condition, were breaking down so frequently. In the documentary “The New York Times Presents: Broken Horses,” now streaming on Hulu, The Times found that reckless breeding and doping practices, compromised veterinarians and trainers, and decades-long resistance to changes that could save horses lives have placed a multibillion-dollar ecosystem in peril and put the social acceptability of one of America’s oldest sports at risk.ImageHavnameltdown sustained an injury to his left front ankle and was euthanized on the racetrack on the undercard of the Preakness Stakes in Baltimore last year.

6,Campus Protests Over Gaza Spotlight the Work of Student Journalists,"Their updates come in harried bursts. Real-time narrations of the scene at Columbia University’s protest encampment in Manhattan, interspersed with the calmer voice of a host in the studio, directing live on air the dozen or so student journalists covering the moment police officers in riot gear moved in to clear an occupied university building Tuesday night.“Do we have a field reporter over on Amsterdam? We have word that arrests are happening on Amsterdam, if we could get a field reporter over there.”“Sorry, Sarah, do you need to go?”“It’s getting really hard for us to report from this vantage.”The stream from the Columbia University student-run radio station, WKCR, was so popular that night that its website crashed. As pro-Palestinian demonstrators seized Hamilton Hall, theirs was one of the most extensive broadcasts from the scene because the school had limited access for professional journalists.Listen to an audio clip from WKCR-FM, Columbia University radio, from the night of April 30.The same is true around the country, where student journalists have provided some of the most detailed and riveting coverage of the protests that have engulfed campuses. The Brown Daily Herald reported on negotiations between the school’s trustee board and the protesters there. The University of Southern California’s paper, The Daily Trojan, Dartmouth College’s The Dartmouth and the University of North Carolina’s Daily Tar Heel have provided minute-by-minute live coverage on X, Instagram and on their websites.The journalists’ efforts have drawn rare praise from the Pulitzer Prize Board, which highlighted in a statement the “extraordinary real-time reporting of student journalists at Columbia University” and around the country, who reported “under difficult and dangerous circumstances and at risk of arrest.”",By Santul Nerkar,2024-05-03 16:29:04-04:00,business,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/03/business/media/campus-protests-columbia-student-media-gaza.html,The New York Times
7,Medical Debt Shows Up Less Often on Credit Reports,"The share of Americans with unpaid medical bills tainting their credit files has fallen in the two years since the major credit reporting agencies — Equifax, Experian and TransUnion — changed how that debt was reported, a federal watchdog agency said this week.But even with the changes, some 15 million people — many of them living in low-income communities and in the South — still have medical bills in their credit files, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau reported. Rohit Chopra, the bureau’s director, said in a statement that “further reforms” were needed to scour medical debt from credit histories. The bureau is considering a rule to ban medical debt from consumer credit files.The bureau estimated in a 2022 report that well over half the debt that appeared on credit reports as being in collection was medical debt. Having unpaid medical bills on your credit report can make it hard to qualify for loans and credit cards, get cellphone service, rent an apartment or even secure a job, since landlords and employers also check applicants’ credit history.Yet the bureau’s research suggests that medical debt is a less useful measure of a borrower’s creditworthiness than other types of debt, largely because of the complexities of the American health care system. People can incur medical bills unexpectedly, and many think that their health insurance will cover the costs. They often must contact insurers, hospitals or doctors and may end up haggling over their correct share of the bill. And the consumer bureau previously found that medical collection debt reported to the credit bureaus was “plagued by inaccuracies.”“There’s a lot of back and forth,” said Breno Braga, a principal research associate at the Urban Institute think tank and a co-author of a recent report on medical debt. “You don’t see that with any other type of debt.”In 2022, amid scrutiny from the consumer bureau, the three major credit reporting agencies voluntarily adopted changes in how medical bills were included in credit files. They agreed to exclude any medical collection debts that had been paid and those that were less than a year old, allowing for time to clarify a patient’s responsibility for the bill. And as of April 2023, the credit bureaus stopped including any medical collections for amounts under $500. (Hospitals and doctors send unpaid bills to collection agencies, which may then report them to the credit bureaus.)",By Ann Carrns,2024-05-03 09:00:23-04:00,your-money,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/03/your-money/medical-debt-credit-reports.html,The New York Times
8,Is It Good to Go Exclusive?,"Paramount’s proposed merger with Skydance has been the most tumultuous media deal in years. Now it has taken yet another turn after the exclusivity period for negotiations expired without an agreement in hand.A month ago, a special committee of Paramount’s board agreed to enter into exclusive talks with Skydance — a Hollywood studio run by the tech scion David Ellison — even as the private equity giant Apollo Global Management reached out with a $26 billion offer. Paramount shareholders grumbled that granting exclusivity was a mistake, and that the company should have engaged with Apollo instead.This week, the special committee told Skydance that it was letting the exclusivity period lapse. The end of exclusivity doesn’t alone kill the deal with Skydance. But it does allow Paramount to open up negotiations with Apollo and Sony Pictures Entertainment, which joined Apollo’s bid.The so far fruitless negotiations raise a question that deal makers have long debated: Why do companies like Paramount agree to exclusivity in the first place?Buyers often prefer exclusivity more than sellers. Exclusivity is a sign from the seller that it is committed to doing a deal and not just using a bid to drum up higher offers.Sellers generally prefer to negotiate without exclusivity because it limits their ability to shop around for a higher price. And since they’ve already signaled to a buyer they’re willing to make a deal, they’ve weakened their bargaining power.","By Lauren Hirsch, Michael J. de la Merced and Ravi Mattu",2024-05-04 08:16:55-04:00,business,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/04/business/is-it-good-to-go-exclusive.html,The New York Times
9,How Scammers Are Stealing Food Stamps From Struggling Americans,"Something was very wrong with Jackie Kirks’s food stamp card.While standing at the checkout line in a cavernous Albertsons grocery store in Long Beach, Calif., last December, Ms. Kirks was told that she didn’t have enough money in her account to pay for food.“That’s impossible,” she told the cashier.Ms. Kirks, 70, knew that she had saved up a sizable sum in monthly benefits from the federal food assistance program, also known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. Until September, she had been homeless, bouncing between weeklong stays at motels and sleeping in her car. To eat, she would buy food through a state program that permitted adults 60 and older, people with disabilities and homeless people to buy discount meals using their food stamps. The program had cost far less than buying groceries, so most of the SNAP money had accumulated in her account.But the cashier at Albertsons was adamant: Ms. Kirks had only $6 in her account. Alarm bells rang in her head as she walked out of the supermarket, empty-handed except for a bottle of water and coffee creamer. She immediately called the state agency that oversaw food benefits. Her heart sank when a caseworker explained that someone had gained access to her card and drained her balance of over $4,000.People like Ms. Kirks who rely on public benefits, such as food stamps, are facing a relentless threat: Scammers are using illegally installed skimming devices to lift payment card data from unsuspecting victims who swipe their payment cards through the devices in stores or at A.T.M.s. The criminals then use the information to create fake payment cards and steal money from victims’ accounts.Skimming schemes started spiking in prevalence around 2022. Thieves target a variety of card-based payments, including those made with credit and debit cards. Welfare programs that use payment cards are similarly vulnerable. Yet, unlike credit and debit cards issued by banks, benefit cards issued by public agencies don’t come with fraud protection, which limits a credit or debit cardholder’s liability for unauthorized charges.The schemes have hit two welfare programs particularly hard: food stamps, which are payments to low-income families that can be used only to buy groceries, and cash assistance, which is a no-strings-attached sum. Both are monthly programs and are transferred to participants through a payment card known as an “electronic benefit transfer,” or E.B.T.",By Jessica Fu,2024-05-04 05:02:42-04:00,business,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/04/business/food-stamps-skimming-scam.html,The New York Times
10,Got an Idea for a Toy? Toymakers Want to Hear From You.,"Near the end of 2022, Lucas Bolt, an environmental artist and Lego enthusiast in Amsterdam, was working on a design for a Lego set the company had crowdsourced to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Dungeons & Dragons, the tabletop role-playing game.“I spent two very intense weeks working on it, every night, every weekend, all the time that I had,” he said.Mr. Bolt was hoping to create the design for Lego Ideas, a program the toymaker started in 2008 to solicit ideas online directly from fans. Typically, designers post their concept on the platform, and if a design gets 10,000 votes, the company considers it for production. This case was different, though: It was the first time the company had given fans a concept to work with.Mr. Bolt had been designing his own sets for a few years, primarily for his followers on Instagram, but this was the first time something he had produced had gained real traction. A panel of judges selected his set and four others for a shortlist, and in a vote fans chose his set as their favorite.Lego Ideas is part of a growing strategy among companies that are creating divisions devoted to going directly to consumers for ideas. Lego takes a more personal approach, allowing fans to submit designs, while other companies poll consumers about what they would like to see or speak to inventors about their latest projects. These initiatives are finding particular success within niche groups of collectors and other highly dedicated fans.Toy companies that have direct-to-consumer models do not have the same audience reach that distributors like Amazon have, but a unit devoted to direct sales still provides advantages for the overall business, said Jaime M. Katz, an analyst who covers the toy industry for Morningstar, a financial services company. The primary reason companies like direct sales is the speed at which they are able to get access to purchasing data from consumers.",By Isaac Aronow,2024-05-04 05:00:14-04:00,business,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/04/business/toys-direct-to-consumer-sales-ideas.html,The New York Times
11,When a Bunch of Bloody Yanks Came for English Soccer,"In the first half of a January game at Stamford Bridge, the London stadium where the Chelsea Football Club has played since its founding in 1905, seven well-groomed spectators in green velvet jackets stood up together from their seats behind the substitutes’ bench as players raced up and down the field in front of them. They pulled out books and began to read. Then they all brushed their teeth.Listen to this article, read by Robert FassThe publicity stunt turned out to be a promotion for the film “Argylle,” which would be released a few weeks later. The use of a Premier League game in a packed stadium as the backdrop was criticized in the English media as yet another transgression by Todd Boehly, an American investor and the most prominent figure among Chelsea’s owners. Boehly, who also owns a sizable piece of the Los Angeles Dodgers, probably saw it as simply another way to generate revenue — no different than putting advertising on shirt fronts, which English clubs have been doing since the 1970s — and something that would be considered part of the spectacle of sports in America.In England, though, many fans perceived it as the further desecration of a cornerstone of national culture: a soccer club’s being treated as an investment to be exploited by a gauche American owner. “That may be fine in U.S. sports,” Pat Nevin, a popular Chelsea player in the 1980s who worked for the club until the end of last season, told me. “But to a football fan, that hurts.” A few months after leaving Chelsea, Nevin went on the BBC to warn against the prospect of adopting a popular feature at many American sports venues. “I told them, ‘No, no, don’t do a Kiss Cam,’” he says. “ ‘Such a small thing, but you can’t imagine the reaction you’re going to get.’”The unabashed attempts to Americanize the English soccer experience range from musical acts as pregame entertainment to the addition of club seats — with waiter service and lounge access — and members-only bars inside stadiums. Later this year, the London club Fulham, which is owned by the Pakistani American businessman Shahid Khan, will unveil a $200 million-plus expansion that includes a stand overlooking the Thames, restaurants curated by a Michelin-starred chef, a street-level produce market and a boutique hotel and spa with an outdoor swimming pool — an attraction also found at the stadium of Khan’s N.F.L. team, the Jacksonville Jaguars. The expectation that such “improvements” mean higher ticket prices led to a fan boycott of a recent game. “People here hold football very, very dearly,” says Nedum Onuoha, who grew up in Manchester and played professionally for several English clubs, before moving to Real Salt Lake in Major League Soccer. “They don’t like change.”The antecedent to such change occurred in 2005, when the first Americans to buy a Premier League club — Malcolm Glazer and his sons, who owned the N.F.L.’s Tampa Bay Buccaneers — acquired control of Manchester United. Almost immediately, other wealthy Americans set out to get clubs of their own. Nearly all of them already had sports teams in the United States. They figured they could bring their successful business practices to English soccer, which in many ways was stuck in the 1960s. Fans were going to games in decades-old stadiums with hard wooden seats and squalid bathrooms. The fare at concession stands was almost exclusively beer and reheated meat pies.",By Bruce Schoenfeld,2024-05-04 00:53:41-04:00,magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/04/magazine/english-soccer-american-owners.html,The New York Times
12,Sam Ash Music Stores to Close After 100 Years in Business,"Sam Ash, the family-owned chain of music stores that supplied countless beginners and working musicians with guitars, drums and other instruments, is closing all of its locations after 100 years in business, it announced this week.Derek Ash, whose great-grandparents, Sam and Rose Ash, opened the first Sam Ash store in the Brownsville section of Brooklyn in 1924, said the company’s 42 locations could not compete in the era of online shopping.In March, Sam Ash announced it was closing 18 locations, with the hope of buying the company time to survive, Mr. Ash said. But he said that closing all the stores ended up being a “necessity.”“A lot of this has been the move to online shopping,” Mr. Ash, the company’s chief marketing officer, said in an interview. “There are so many choices, and to maintain a store with that much selection is very difficult.”Sam Ash has stores in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Florida, North Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, California, Pennsylvania, Nevada and Ohio, Mr. Ash said. Some will close by the end of the month, he said. All will close by the end of July.The news, which the company announced on Thursday, saddened many musicians who recalled buying instruments and equipment at Sam Ash or just stopping in to try out guitars, amps or keyboards — a tactile, communal experience that can’t be replicated online.",By Michael Levenson,2024-05-03 18:17:18-04:00,business,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/03/business/sam-ash-music-closing-stores.html,The New York Times
13,"Paramount Will Let Exclusive Talks With Skydance Lapse, Imperiling Deal","Paramount told Skydance that it would not extend the Hollywood studio’s exclusive window to negotiate a merger, two people with knowledge of the decisions said Friday, imperiling the deal but opening the door to other suitors for the owner of MTV and Nickelodeon.The development throws up a major roadblock for Skydance, a movie studio that has been negotiating a complicated deal to merge with Paramount for months. Many Paramount investors have come out against that deal, saying it would enrich Shari Redstone, the company’s board chair, at the expense of other shareholders.The 30-day period for exclusive talks with a special committee of Paramount’s board expires at the end of Friday. It is unclear what Skydance, which was founded by the tech scion and producer David Ellison, and its backer, RedBird Capital Partners, will do next. The company could wait for Paramount to re-engage in negotiations, could make a higher bid or could walk away. The company is wary of being used by Paramount to drive up the price for another bidder.Paramount’s special committee will now probably focus on negotiating with another suitor, Sony Pictures Entertainment, which has teamed up with the private equity giant Apollo Global Management to make a $26 billion bid for the company. Paramount’s shareholders prefer the all-cash offer — which would include the assumption of Paramount’s debt — because it would give them a substantial premium on the company’s current stock price.Paramount’s special committee is set to meet on Saturday to discuss the deal, the two people with knowledge of the company’s plans said.The deal with Sony and Apollo is not without its own risk. Government regulations restrict foreign ownership of broadcast networks, like Paramount’s CBS. Sony Pictures Entertainment is a division of the Tokyo-based Sony Group, and it’s unlikely that it could obtain a license to own CBS. But there are potential remedies to that problem: Apollo could apply to hold the license to CBS, or the group could decide to sell the network.Paramount’s fate ultimately lies in Ms. Redstone’s hands. Her control of National Amusements, Paramount’s parent company, gives her the power to block any deal. Ms. Redstone has already signed off on a potential deal between Skydance and National Amusements that would allow her to sell her stake for around $2 billion, but that deal hinges on approval of a merger of Paramount and Skydance.CNBC earlier reported that Paramount was planning to end exclusive negotiations with Skydance.Benjamin Mullin reports on the major companies behind news and entertainment.

14,Jobs Data Revives Wall Street’s Hopes for a Rate Cut,"Just as Wall Street appeared to come to terms with the idea of high interest rates sticking around for longer, a cooler-than-expected jobs report on Friday brought the idea of rate cuts back into the conversation.The Labor Department reported that job and wage growth in April came in lower than economists had expected, a shift after months of piping-hot labor market reports. The findings rekindled hopes that the Federal Reserve — which has been looking for signs that interest rates are slowing the economy — may yet cut rates before the end of the year.“This is the jobs report the Fed would have scripted,” said Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management.The S&P 500 rose 1.3 percent on Friday, its best day in more than two months. The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies that are more sensitive to the ebb and flow of the economy also rose, up 1 percent for the day and also on course to rise for a second consecutive week.Stock investors are sensitive to rapid changes in interest rates, and the two-year Treasury yield tumbled from over 5 percent on Tuesday to 4.8 percent on Friday, a big move in a market that is typically measured in hundredths of a percentage point.Investors had started the week fearful that strong economic data and stubborn inflation would push the Fed to keep interest rates elevated for most of the year and potentially even warrant officials to move them higher.Investors had already welcomed comments on Wednesday from the Fed chair, Jerome Powell, who said it was “unlikely” the central bank would raise rates further, despite earlier intimations from some policymakers that an increase might be necessary given the strength of the U.S. economy this year.Investors now expect the Fed to cut rates at least once and potentially twice this year, with bets that the first cut will come in September, earlier than the November expectation at the start of the week.Investors’ optimism for falling rates also spurred a sell-off in the dollar, a welcome sign for countries around the world whose currencies have been pressured by unexpected dollar strength this year. Expectations that interest rates will come down tends to weigh on a currency as investors look for more lucrative places to park their money.Some investors still cautioned against reading too much into Friday’s jobs data.Jason Pride, a strategist at the asset management firm Glenmede, said investors needed to see more progress before they could expect imminent rate cuts. Another hot jobs or inflation report could be enough to keep the Fed from considering any cuts this year.“One month does not make a trend, but today’s jobs report likely gives the Fed some much-needed assurance that higher rates may be starting to do their job,” Mr. Pride said.J.

15,"Overlooked No More: Min Matheson, Labor Leader Who Faced Down Mobsters","This article is part of Overlooked, a series of obituaries about remarkable people whose deaths, beginning in 1851, went unreported in The Times.It was in northeastern Pennsylvania that Min Matheson earned her reputation for fearlessness. Over her 20 years as director of the International Ladies’ Garment Workers’ Union there, she repeatedly faced down mobsters in her fight for fair wages and safe conditions for women workers.In one incident, she confronted several menacing “tough guys,” as she called them, in Pittston, Pa., where she was marching on a picket line alongside other women.She told them, “You rotten hoodlums! What are you doing in this town?” she recalled in an oral history interview. “You don’t live here. We live here. This is our town, not yours.”Nearby homeowners opened their windows to watch the ruckus. “There are witnesses to anything you think you are going to do,” Matheson told the thugs.

16,Furor Over U.S. Steel Bid Puts Secretive Government Panel In Spotlight,"At a campaign event last month in Pennsylvania, the heartland of American steel manufacturing, President Biden made clear that he does not want the proposed takeover of U.S. Steel by Japan’s Nippon Steel to happen.“We’re finally making sure that United States Steel stays United States Steel,” Mr. Biden said. “It’s not going to be anybody else’s steel.”How that promise will be kept has yet to be determined. U.S. Steel said this week in its first-quarter earnings release that it expected the acquisition to be completed in the second half of this year, but noted that timing depended on getting regulatory approvals.On Friday, Nippon Steel said it was delaying its timeline for the deal to close, from the middle of the year to the end of 2024, because it had been asked to provide more information about the transaction to the Department of Justice, which is reviewing the deal.The intensifying scrutiny of the acquisition has raised expectations that the $15 billion buyout could ultimately be scuttled by the Biden administration. It has also called attention to the secretive interagency panel that could be the ultimate arbiter of the merger: the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States.With a presidential election six months away and opposition to the deal strong among union members and some Senate Democrats, the opaque committee is facing pressure to conclude that a deal involving a company of a top American ally threatens national security.",By Alan Rappeport,2024-05-03 12:59:55-04:00,us,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/03/us/politics/us-steel-nippon-steel-biden-cfius.html,The New York Times
17,Auditor That Works for Trump Media Is Charged With Fraud,"An accounting firm that audits the financial statements of hundreds of public companies including former President Donald J. Trump’s social media company can no longer do so, U.S. securities regulators said on Friday.The Securities and Exchange Commission charged the firm, BF Borgers, with fraud, saying that it had failed to comply with accounting rules. In settling with the S.E.C., the firm agreed to immediately stop filing audited statements on behalf of its clients.The regulator held BF Borgers and its owner, Benjamin F. Borgers, responsible for “deliberate and systemic failures” to comply with accounting rules. The accompanying settlement requires both the firm and Mr. Borgers to pay a total of $14 million in civil penalties. Many companies that used BF Borgers must now find new auditors.Trump Media & Technology Group, the parent company of the Truth Social platform, has been a client of BF Borgers since 2022, according to regulatory filings. But for most of that time, Trump Media was a private company.Trump Media went public only in March after completing its merger with a cash-rich shell company. Even though the company is not mentioned in connection with the BF Borgers settlement, shares of Trump Media fell around 7 percent on the news but closed the day just 1.5 percent lower.Trump Media, in a statement, said it “looks forward to working with new auditing partners in accordance with today’s S.E.C. order.”In announcing the enforcement action and settlement, the S.E.C. said that BF Borgers, based in Colorado, had audited hundreds of public companies. Regulators said the violations affected more than 1,500 corporate filings.Gurbir S. Grewal, the S.E.C. director of enforcement, called the failures at BF Borgers “one of the largest wholesale failures by gatekeepers in our financial markets.”The S.E.C. said it had found that the audit firm sometimes copied work it had previously done for clients and simply changed dates on filings. In the process, regulators said, the firm “falsely documented work that had not been performed.”Audit firms play a critical role on Wall Street and are supposed to make sure that a public company’s financial statements are accurate and in order. Investors rely on financial statements that have been reviewed and certified by auditing firms in making investment decisions.The S.E.C. release said there was “no known defense counsel” for BF Borgers. In settling with the S.E.C., the audit firm and Mr. Borgers neither admitted nor denied the charges.The S.E.C. issued instructions to public companies on how to respond to the settlement. In the filing, the regulator said companies must file a regulatory notice when an audit firm resigned or was fired.Matthew Goldstein covers Wall Street and white-collar crime and housing issues.

18,TikTok Tells Advertisers: ‘We Are Not Backing Down’,"Hundreds of advertisers, including major brands like L’Oreal and Victoria’s Secret, flocked to the Lower East Side on Thursday night for TikTok’s annual spring pitch to marketers. It had been about a week since President Biden signed a law that says TikTok must be sold from its Chinese parent company or face a potential ban, and marketers were champing at the bit to hear TikTok’s thoughts.They didn’t have to wait long. Blake Chandlee, TikTok’s president of global business solutions, kicked off the evening by thanking advertisers for their “tremendous support and trust” and said the company considered the law unconstitutional and would challenge it in court.“We believe the facts and the law are clearly on our side and that we will ultimately prevail,” Mr. Chandlee told more than 300 attendees, some of whom couldn’t find chairs in the crowd. “I want you to know we are not backing down.”But for the rest of the roughly 45-minute presentation, which took place in a large gallery with the fuchsia and light blue lights of TikTok’s logo, it was business as usual. And it was a keen reminder that Madison Avenue’s concerns about TikTok, which center on how to cleverly market their products and ensure that consumers are seeing their ads, are vastly different from those of Washington, where officials consider the app a national security risk.Sofia Hernandez, TikTok’s global head of business marketing, declared that TikTok had gone from “being viral to vital” for businesses. The company’s executives introduced new tools for running ads against trends and events like the Summer Olympics in Paris. A Unilever marketing executive described how the Vaseline brand had thrived by tapping into a TikTok skin care trend known as “slugging.” Many marketers were visibly confused until she explained that the term referred to slathering one’s face with petroleum jelly before bedtime to seal in other serums and moisturizers.“TikTok is the most interesting story in advertising right now,” said Craig Brommers, chief marketing officer of the retailer American Eagle, who attended the event. “That’s why you had a standing-room-only audience waiting to hear what’s next for the most important video platform for Gen Z.”",By Sapna Maheshwari,2024-05-03 11:25:34-04:00,business,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/03/business/media/tiktok-advertisers.html,The New York Times
19,Horse Racing’s Loudest Critic Is Favored in Its Biggest Race,"In the world according to Mike Repole, everyone involved in horse racing is a dummy. Except him, Mike from Queens or the Commish, as some of his followers on X call him.Stuart S. Janney III, chairman of the nonprofit Jockey Club, is clueless and tone deaf and has run the sport into the ground, Repole says. Churchill Downs Inc., which hosts the Kentucky Derby, is cheap: The $5 million purse for America’s most famous race should be much more, and the racetrack treats Repole and other owners badly.Forget about John Stewart, a new owner bringing fresh energy and big money into the game. He is “arrogant, free spending” and such a rube that he has an “$8 haircut.”All the above, and many others, are among Repole’s frequent targets on social media and various podcasts. Repole, a prominent horse owner who made his fortune in the beverage industry, says he is merely trying to disrupt an industry (often punctuated with profane Bronx cheers) that he likens to the Titanic heading inevitably into a looming iceberg.“You want real or you want fake??? You want loud or you want quiet??? You want intensity or you want passive??? You want better or you want worse??? Love me or Hate me,” Repole posted on X in January, summarizing his credo for remaking the racehorse business.ImageRepole, right, with Fierceness last week.

20,The Fed Just Got the Job Market Cooling It Has Been Waiting For,"Federal Reserve officials are keeping a close eye on the job market as they contemplate when and whether they can cut interest rates this year. Friday's jobs report offered early evidence of the type of moderation that they have been hoping to see.Average hourly earnings, a measure of wage growth, climbed 3.9 percent in April from a year earlier. That was both cooler than the previous reading and slightly cooler than the 4 percent economists had forecast.That moderation came as job gains slowed to 175,000 during the month, the unemployment rate ticked up slightly and average weekly hours nudged down. The overall picture was one of a labor market that remains solid but is gradually slowing — exactly what officials at the Fed have been looking for.Central bankers generally embrace a strong job market: One of their two mandates from Congress is to foster maximum employment. But when inflation is rapid, as it has been since 2021, officials worry that a hot labor market could help to keep price gains elevated. If employers are competing for workers and paying more, they are likely to also try to charge more, the theory goes. And workers who are earning slightly bigger paychecks may have the wherewithal to pay more without pulling back.“The more jobs reports you get like this,” then “the more confident we can be that the economy is not overheating,” Austan Goolsbee, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, said in a Bloomberg Television interview. Mr. Goolsbee does not vote on monetary policy this year.At the Fed’s policy meeting this week, officials kept interest rates at 5.3 percent, the highest level in more than two decades. The central bank started 2024 expecting to cut rates several times, but those plans have been delayed by surprisingly stubborn inflation.",By Jeanna Smialek,2024-05-03 09:33:41-04:00,business,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/03/business/april-jobs-report-federal-reserve.html,The New York Times
21,What Will Warren Buffett Bet on Next?,"ImageImageBerkshire Hathaway shareholders and admirers of Warren Buffett will gather in Omaha tomorrow looking for investment tips and more.Credit...Rachel Mummey/ReutersA different kind of Berkshire annual meetingTens of thousands of investors are flocking to Omaha this weekend, which can mean only one thing: It’s time for Berkshire Hathaway’s annual shareholder meeting, dubbed the “Woodstock for capitalists.”The allure had long been the chance to see Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger live, answering attendees’ questions with a time-tested buddy-comedy act. But this year’s event will be the first without Munger, who died in November at age 99 — and comes amid growing questions about Berkshire post-Buffett, who’s 93.Buffett will have a different crew answering questions alongside him on Saturday. Berkshire’s vice chairmen, Greg Abel and Ajit Jain, will be on hand for much of the day. Shareholders most likely will be focused on what Abel, Buffett’s appointed successor as C.E.O. and the head of the conglomerate’s noninsurance operations, has to say.In Buffett’s annual letter to investors, he noted challenges to Berkshire’s biggest businesses, including the BNSF railroad (falling shipment volumes) and its utility business (forest fires). Last month, the company’s enormous real estate brokerage, HomeServices of America, also agreed to pay $250 million to settle lawsuits over inflated home-sales commissions.Shareholders may want to hear what Jain, as the longtime mastermind behind Berkshire’s vital reinsurance operations, has to say about the business that makes most of Buffett’s investing possible.Expect lots of questions about Berkshire’s signature investments. The company’s stock performance this year has outpaced that of Apple (one of Buffett’s biggest investments; more on that below), Microsoft and Tesla, as well as the S&P 500.","By Andrew Ross Sorkin, Ravi Mattu, Bernhard Warner, Sarah Kessler, Michael J. de la Merced, Lauren Hirsch and Ephrat Livni",2024-05-03 07:26:48-04:00,business,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/03/business/dealbook/warren-buffett-berkshire-hathaway-agm.html,The New York Times
22,"U.S. Job Market Eases, but Hiring Remains Firm","The American job market may be shifting into a lower gear this spring, a turn that economists have expected for months after a vigorous rebound from the pandemic shock.Employers added 175,000 positions in April, the Labor Department reported Friday, undershooting forecasts. The unemployment rate ticked up to 3.9 percent.A less torrid expansion after the 242,000-job average over the prior 12 months isn’t necessarily bad news, given that layoffs have remained low and most sectors appear stable.“It’s not a bad economy; it’s still a healthy economy,” said Perc Pineda, chief economist at the Plastics Industry Association. “I think it’s part of the cycle. We cannot continue robust growth indefinitely considering the limits of our economy.”The labor market has defied projections of a considerable slowdown for over a year in the face of a rapid escalation in borrowing costs, a minor banking crisis and two major wars. But economic growth declined markedly in the first quarter, suggesting that the exuberance of the last two years might be settling into a more sustainable rhythm.Year-over-year percentage change in earnings vs. inflation

23,Calls to Divest From Israel Put Students and Donors on Collision Course,"Desperate to stem protests that have convulsed campuses across the country, a small number of universities have agreed to reconsider their investments in companies that do business with Israel.The deals, which have eased tension on campuses with only a few days left before students break for the summer, would have been unthinkable even a week ago. And they’re a gamble, potentially putting universities on a collision course with influential donors, politicians and students who support Israel.The schools are still far from pulling money: Brown University, the liberal Ivy League institution, agreed this week only to hold a board vote this fall on whether its $6.6 billion endowment should divest from any Israeli-connected holdings. In exchange, the pro-Palestinian encampment on the campus's main lawn was dismantled.Northwestern University and the University of Minnesota have also struck deals with student protesters to clear camps in exchange for a commitment to discuss the schools’ investment policies around Israel. The moves could add pressure on administrators at Columbia University, the University of Michigan and the University of North Carolina, among others, where protesters have made divestment from Israel a central rallying cry.The issue of financial divestment from Israel has long been an untouchable one, both in American politics and among the Wall Street titans who manage university endowments and make up a large source of donations. Taking sides now is a surefire way to inflame at least one faction in a conflict that has divided campuses, split the Democratic Party and handed Republican lawmakers a cudgel with which to attack the institutions.Even the renewed talk of divestment has raised alarms among the well-heeled donors whom few universities dare cross, and who have exerted influence over the debate on college campuses since Hamas’s Oct. 7 attack on Israel and the subsequent invasion of Gaza. Billionaires, including the fund manager William A. Ackman and Marc Rowan, a private-equity chieftain, mounted campaigns to remove the presidents of Harvard University and the University of Pennsylvania over their handling of antisemitism on their campuses.","By Santul Nerkar, Rob Copeland and Maureen Farrell",2024-05-03 05:05:09-04:00,business,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/03/business/brown-university-divestment-israel-gaza.html,The New York Times
24,Sony and Apollo Express Interest in Buying Paramount in $26 Billion Deal,"Sony Pictures Entertainment and the private equity giant Apollo Global Management have formally expressed interest in acquiring Paramount for roughly $26 billion, according to two people familiar with the matter, a move that adds drama to an already chaotic deal making process.The nonbinding expression of interest, sent in a letter this week, comes as Paramount approaches an agreed-upon Friday deadline for the expiration of an exclusive negotiating period with Skydance, a Hollywood studio run by the tech scion David Ellison. Paramount has been in talks with Skydance for months, discussing a complicated transaction that would involve a merger and an investment from the private equity firm Redbird Capital Partners.The new, joint expression of interest would make Sony a significant majority and controlling shareholder and Apollo a minority shareholder. The proposed all-cash acquisition may appeal to Paramount shareholders who have come out against the Skydance deal over concerns it benefits the company’s controlling shareholder, Shari Redstone, at the expense of others.Paramount declined to comment.The proposed merger of Sony and Paramount would create a new powerhouse in Hollywood, uniting the studios behind the “Spider Man” and “Mission: Impossible” franchises. Sony executives have discussed operating the Paramount studio as a division of their broader empire, combining their marketing and distribution functions.Sony, a sprawling international conglomerate known for its cutting-edge electronics business, is an unconventional suitor for Paramount. Like Comcast, which owns NBCUniversal, Sony has a highly profitable business outside traditional media, generating hundreds of millions of dollars from video games, music, imaging and sensors. That insulates Sony from the travails of the media industry, which has lately been challenged by the decline of the traditional theatrical business and the death of cable television.The letter, which was signed by Tony Vinciquerra, the chief executive of Sony Pictures Entertainment, and Aaron Sobel, a partner at Apollo, is intended to be a starting point for negotiations to acquire the company, according to be a person familiar with the matter. The two sides have not begun doing due diligence, a process that could affect the amount Sony and Apollo are willing to pay.",By Benjamin Mullin and Lauren Hirsch,2024-05-02 13:27:35-04:00,business,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/02/business/media/sony-apollo-paramount-deal.html,The New York Times
25,"The Fed Is Eyeing the Job Market, but It’s Difficult to Read","The Federal Reserve spent much of 2022 and 2023 narrowly focusing on inflation as policymakers set interest rates: Prices were rising way too fast, so they became the central bank’s top priority. But now that inflation has cooled, officials are more clearly factoring the job market into their decisions again.One potential challenge? It’s a very difficult moment to assess exactly what monthly labor market data are telling us.Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, said during a news conference on Wednesday that the way the job market shaped up in coming months could help to guide whether and when the central bank lowered interest rates this year. A substantial weakening could prod policymakers to cut, he suggested. If job growth remains rapid and inflation remains stuck, on the other hand, the combination could keep the Fed from lowering interest rates anytime soon.But it is tough to guess which of those scenarios may play out — and it is trickier than usual to determine how hot today’s job market is, especially in real time. Fed officials will get their latest reading on Friday morning, when the Labor Department releases its April employment report.Hiring has been rapid in recent months. That would typically make economists nervous that the economy was on the cusp of overheating: Businesses would risk competing for the same workers, pushing up wages in a way that could eventually drive up prices.But this hiring boom is different. It has come as a wave of immigrants and workers coming in from the labor market’s sidelines have helped to notably increase the supply of applicants. That has allowed companies to hire without depleting the labor pool.",By Jeanna Smialek,2024-05-02 13:17:52-04:00,business,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/02/business/economy/the-fed-job-market.html,The New York Times
26,"Campus Protests Give Russia, China and Iran Fuel to Exploit U.S. Divide","An article on a fake online news outlet that Meta has linked to Russia’s information operations attributed the clashes unfolding on American college campuses to the failures of the Biden administration. A newspaper controlled by the Communist Party of China said the police crackdowns exposed the “double standards and hypocrisy” in the United States when it comes to free speech.On X, a spokesman for Iran’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Nasser Kanaani, posted a cartoon of the police arresting a young protester in the guise of the Statue of Liberty. “Imprisonment of #freedom in the U.S.A.,” he wrote.As protests over the war in Gaza have spread across the United States, Russia, China and Iran have seized on them to score geopolitical points abroad and stoke tensions within the United States, according to researchers who have identified both overt and covert efforts by the countries to amplify the protests since they began.There is little evidence — at least so far — that the countries have provided material or organizational support to the protests, the way Russia recruited unwitting Black Lives Matter protesters to stage rallies before the 2016 and 2020 presidential elections.Nonetheless, the campaigns have portrayed the United States as a country rived by social and political turmoil. In the past two weeks alone, state media in Russia, China and Iran have produced nearly 400 articles in English about the protests, according to NewsGuard, an organization that tracks misinformation online. The countries have also unleashed a wave of content through inauthentic accounts or bots on social media platforms like X and Telegram or websites created, in Russia’s case, to mimic Western news organizations.“It’s a wound that our adversaries are going to try to spread salt on because they can,” said Darren Linvill, a director of the Media Forensics Hub at Clemson University, which has identified campaigns by all three countries. “The more we fight amongst ourselves, the easier their life is and the more they can get away with.”",By Steven Lee Myers and Tiffany Hsu,2024-05-02 13:09:49-04:00,business,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/02/business/media/campus-protests-russia-china-iran-us.html,The New York Times
27,Can a ‘Not Charlotte’ Recipe Revive a Region?,"Scott Kidd didn’t expect a terribly busy job when he became the town manager of Liberty, N.C., a onetime furniture and textile hub whose rhythms more recently centered on a yearly antiques festival.Those quiet times, less than three years ago, soon became a whirlwind. Toyota announced it was building a battery factory on the town’s rural outskirts for electric and hybrid vehicles, and since then Mr. Kidd has reviewed ordinances, met with housing developers and otherwise sought to meet the needs of a seven-million-square-foot facility.The flurry of activity reflects new investments in a region of North Carolina that has lagged behind: the Triad. The average income in Randolph County, which includes Liberty, is $47,000, and some jobs at Toyota will offer an hourly wage comfortably above that. More people moving into the area could breathe life into Liberty’s downtown.But the potential dividends for the area — which includes Greensboro, Winston-Salem and High Point, in the center of the state — depend on equipping its workers with the skills needed for those new jobs. Mr. Kidd worried that many local workers lacked the education and skills to work at the plant.For those jobs, “they don’t write anything down — they put it in a computer,” Mr. Kidd said. “And if you don’t know how to do that, you kind of get x-ed out.”At the same time, some residents and local leaders who welcome the new industries worry about maintaining the area’s character, lest it become like the rapidly growing — and expensive — sprawls elsewhere in the South.",By Santul Nerkar and Mike Belleme,2024-05-02 11:23:34-04:00,business,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/02/business/economy/north-carolina-triad-economy.html,The New York Times
28,F.T.C. Clears Exxon Mobil’s Acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources,"The Federal Trade Commission on Thursday approved Exxon Mobil’s acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources as long as Exxon excludes Pioneer’s chief executive from its board.The $60 billion deal between the two Texas companies, which may become final as early as this week, would produce the dominant oil and gas producer in the Permian Basin, the country’s largest oil field, which is in Texas and New Mexico. Exxon’s purchase of Pioneer is one of several large mergers and acquisitions in the oil and gas industry in recent years.The F.T.C. accused Pioneer’s chief executive, Scott Sheffield, of colluding with officers of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies to control global oil production and prices.“Mr. Sheffield’s past conduct makes it crystal clear that he should be nowhere near Exxon’s boardroom,” Kyle Mach, deputy director of the commission’s Bureau of Competition, said in a statement. “American consumers shouldn’t pay unfair prices at the pump simply to pad a corporate executive’s pocketbook.”The F.T.C. said Mr. Sheffield had “sought to align oil production across the Permian Basin” with OPEC and its allies through his public statements, and in messages to and personal meetings with other oil executives. The commission said he had exchanged “hundreds of text messages” with representatives and officials of the cartel discussing the oil market, prices and production.Mr. Sheffield has long been a leader of the U.S. oil industry as an early explorer of shale deposits in Texas. He also pushed federal lawmakers to end a ban on oil exports, an effort that succeeded during the Obama administration.Exxon said that it had agreed not to add Mr. Sheffield to its board. Exxon said the F.T.C.’s allegations against Mr. Sheffield “are entirely inconsistent with how we do business.”Pioneer Natural Resources disputed the commission’s accusations, saying Mr. Sheffield had never sought to collude with other oil producers.“We disagree and are surprised,” Pioneer said in a statement. “During Mr. Sheffield’s career, it was neither the intent nor an effect of his communications to circumvent the laws and principles protecting market competition.”The company noted that from 2019 to 2023 Pioneer more than doubled the amount of oil it produced in the United States, helping to bring down energy prices.Mr. Sheffield declined to comment beyond Pioneer’s statement.Shares of Exxon and Pioneer were up about 1 percent on Thursday morning.Clifford Krauss reports on the energy industry, focusing on the transition to renewable resources in a warming world.

29,Universal Music Artists Will Return to TikTok,"TikTok and Universal Music Group have reached a new licensing deal, ending a three-month stalemate that had blocked songs from some of pop’s biggest stars from the influential social media platform.In a joint announcement early Thursday, the two companies said that they had agreed to a “multi-dimensional” new deal that included “improved remuneration” for Universal’s roster of artists and songwriters, and would address the label’s concerns over the growth of A.I.-generated content on the app.In statements that accompanied the announcement, Shou Chew, the chief executive of TikTok, called music “an integral part of the TikTok ecosystem.” Lucian Grainge, the chief executive of Universal — the world’s biggest music company, with a roster of artists including Taylor Swift, Ariana Grande, Billie Eilish, Drake and U2 — called the deal a “new chapter in our relationship with TikTok” that “focuses on the value of music, the primacy of human artistry and the welfare of the creative community.”In an internal email to Universal employees, a copy of which was seen by The New York Times, Grainge said that under the new agreement, “artist and songwriter compensation will be greater than under our prior TikTok deal.”The agreement ends the music industry’s biggest and most contentious dispute with a tech platform in years. Both companies hurled public accusations at each other, and artists from across the spectrum worried about whether their careers would be hurt by the absence of their music from TikTok, which has become a vital promotional platform and boasts more than 170 million users in the United States alone.",By Ben Sisario,2024-05-02 10:03:06-04:00,arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/02/arts/music/tiktok-universal-music-deal.html,The New York Times

31,"Global Growth Forecast Is Lifted but Risks Loom, O.E.C.D. Says","Global inflation is starting to cool after aggressive campaigns by central banks to bring high prices under control, and the economic outlook is brightening after a turbulent period, but clouds loom over the recovery, according to a forecast released on Thursday.The rebound is unfolding at an uneven speed around the world, and geopolitical tensions could pose a major risk to growth and inflation — especially if the conflict in the Middle East and attacks in the Red Sea, a critical shipping zone for trade, were to widen, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a think tank in Paris, said in its latest economic survey.“The global economy has proved resilient, inflation has declined within sight of central bank targets and risks to the outlook are becoming more balanced,” the organization’s secretary-general, Mathias Cormann, said during a news conference Thursday in Paris. “But uncertainty remains.”Inflation among the 38 O.E.C.D. member countries is expected to fall to 4.8 percent this year and 3.5 percent in 2025, after hitting 9.4 percent in 2022, when Russia’s invasion of Ukraine helped set off an energy crisis. Inflation in the United States and in the euro area is expected to fall this year and next toward a 2 percent target that policymakers say is essential for maintaining the stability of prices.“We’ve been through an inflation shock of a generation,” the organization’s chief economist, Clare Lombardelli, said during the briefing. The biggest price increases have been for essential items like food and energy, she said, adding, “Those on the lowest incomes have been squeezed.”High interest rates have helped bring prices down, but there is still a risk that inflation may stay higher for longer than expected, Ms. Lombardelli said.",By Liz Alderman,2024-05-02 09:32:09-04:00,business,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/02/business/global-economy-inflation.html,The New York Times

33,What Will It Take for the Fed to Lower Rates?,"ImageImageJay Powell, the Fed chair, says the central bank is not ready to start talking interest-rate cuts.Credit...Pete Marovich for The New York TimesThe wait continues Global markets are still processing the probability that U.S. interest rates will remain higher for longer, as the Fed acknowledges that high inflation has forced it into a holding pattern on interest rates.That’s putting new emphasis on Friday’s jobs report, as Wall Street and policymakers look for clues on how the labor market is affecting inflation and the wider economy.U.S. futures are pointing to a modest rise after stocks in some parts of Asia and Europe sank. That came after a topsy-turvy final hour of trading on Wednesday in New York: The S&P 500 surged when Jay Powell, the Fed chair, said during his news conference that an interest-rate increase was “unlikely” — only to plunge when he backed away from offering clear guidance on when cuts may be coming.The Fed needs “greater confidence” that inflation is headed down, Powell said, citing the central bank’s longstanding target of 2 percent. (That level remains the subject of persistent debate.) But, if anything, price data has shown inflation rising since the start of the year.At the same time, consumer sentiment has fallen, with bellwether companies including Starbucks and McDonald’s reporting disappointing first-quarter sales. “Everybody’s fighting for fewer consumers or consumers that are certainly visiting less frequently,” Ian Borden, McDonald’s C.F.O., told analysts on Tuesday.Other takeaways from Powell’s comments:He thinks that inflation will creep down “over the course of this year.” But that’s still not enough conviction for the Fed to be more specific about its outlook on cuts.The futures market on Thursday was penciling in 0.35 percentage points’ worth of cuts this year to the Fed’s prime lending rate, compared with predictions in January that the central bank would lower by more than 1.5 percentage points.Powell does not see a risk of stagflation. The economy is growing at roughly 3 percent and the inflation rate is under 3 percent over the past year, he said, adding, “I don’t see the stag, or the flation.”Friday’s nonfarm payrolls report is in the spotlight. Economists forecast that employers added 233,000 jobs last month, keeping the unemployment rate steady at 3.8 percent. That’s despite some headline-grabbing layoffs in recent weeks at Alphabet, Tesla and Apple.","By Andrew Ross Sorkin, Ravi Mattu, Bernhard Warner, Sarah Kessler, Michael J. de la Merced, Lauren Hirsch and Ephrat Livni",2024-05-02 07:57:07-04:00,business,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/02/business/dealbook/fed-powell-interest-rates.html,The New York Times
34,"Larry Young, Who Studied the Chemistry of Love, Dies at 56","Prairie voles are stocky rodents and Olympian tunnellers that surface in grassy areas to feast on grass, roots and seeds with their chisel-shaped teeth, sprouting migraines in farmers and gardeners.But to Larry Young, they were the secret to understanding romance and love.Professor Young, a neuroscientist at Emory University in Atlanta, used prairie voles in a series of experiments that revealed the chemical process for the pirouette of heart-fluttering emotions that poets have tried to put into words for centuries.He died on March 21 in Tsukuba, Japan, where he was helping to organize a scientific conference. He was 56. His wife, Anne Murphy, said the cause was a heart attack.With their beady eyes, thick tails and sharp claws, prairie voles are not exactly cuddly. But among rodents, they are uniquely domestic: They are monogamous, and the males and females form a family unit to raise their offspring together.“Prairie voles, if you take away their partner, they show behavior similar to depression,” Professor Young told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 2009. “It’s almost as if there’s withdrawal from their partner.”That made them ideal for laboratory studies examining the chemistry of love.ImageMales and female prairie voles are known to form a family unit to raise their offspring together.Credit...Todd Ahern/Emory University, via Associated Press",By Michael S.

35,"Robert Oxnam, China Scholar Beset by Multiple Personalities, Dies at 81","Robert B. Oxnam, an eminent China scholar who learned through psychotherapy that his years of erratic behavior could be explained by the torment of having multiple personalities, died on April 18 at his home in Greenport, N.Y., on the North Fork of Long Island. He was 81.His wife, Vishakha Desai, said the cause was complications of Alzheimer’s disease.In the 1ate 1980s, Dr. Oxnam was president of the Asia Society, a television commentator and an accomplished sailor. But his psyche was exceedingly frail. He had myriad problems, including intermittent rages, bulimia, memory blackouts and depression, but it was for excessive drinking that he first sought treatment, from Dr. Jeffery Smith, a psychiatrist.The first personality to emerge in that therapy was Tommy, an angry boy, followed by others, like Bobby, an impish teenager, and Baby, who revealed what appeared to have been abuse when Dr. Oxnam was very young.In his 2005 book, “A Fractured Mind: My Life With Multiple Personality Disorder,” Dr. Oxnam recalled the session when Tommy first spoke to Dr. Smith. All that Dr. Oxnam could remember from the 50-minute session, he wrote, was telling the psychiatrist that he didn’t think the therapy was working for him. But Dr. Smith told him that he had been speaking to Tommy all that time.“He’s full of anger,” Dr. Smith told him. “And he’s inside you.”“You’re kidding?” Dr. Oxnam replied.His 11 personalities took up residence inside Dr. Oxnam’s brain and acted out in real life, and nearly all appeared during therapy with Dr. Smith. Wanda had a Buddhist-like presence who was once submerged in the cruel personality known as the Witch. Bobby, who loved Rollerblading with bottles balanced on his head, had an affair with a young woman, a revelation that startled Dr. Oxnam and his wife.",By Richard Sandomir,2024-05-02 15:16:43-04:00,health,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/02/health/robert-b-oxnam-dead.html,The New York Times
36,"Orangutan, Heal Thyself","Scientists observed a wild male orangutan repeatedly rubbing chewed-up leaves of a medicinal plant on a facial wound in a forest reserve in Indonesia.It was the first known observation of a wild animal using a plant to treat a wound, and adds to evidence that humans are not alone in using plants for medicinal purposes.The male orangutan, Rakus, lives in the Gunung Leuser National Park on the island of Sumatra and is thought to be around 35 years old. For years researchers have followed orangutans like him on his travels through the forest, threading his way through the canopy in search of fruits to eat.Scientists within the Suaq Balimbing research area of the park first noticed a wound on his face on June 25, 2022, when they saw his self-medication behavior begin.“Once I heard about it, I got extremely excited,” said Isabelle Laumer, a primatologist with the Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior in Germany, in part because records of animals medicating themselves are rare — even more so when it comes to treating injuries. She and colleagues detailed the discovery in a study published Thursday in the journal Scientific Reports.The plant Rakus used, known as akar kuning or yellow root, is also used by people throughout Southeast Asia to treat malaria, diabetes and other conditions.

37,Walnuts Recalled From Natural Food Stores After E. Coli Outbreak,"A California company is recalling organic walnuts that were sold at natural food stores and coop retailers in 19 states because of an E. coli outbreak that has sickened 12 people and hospitalized seven, federal officials said.Gibson Farms, the company based in Hollister, Calif., is voluntarily recalling its shelled walnuts branded as Organic Light Halves and Pieces after discovering that the nuts could carry the E. coli strain O157: H7 that “causes a diarrheal illness often with bloody stools,” the Food and Drug Administration said in a notice on Tuesday.The recall came after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention notified the company of 12 recorded illnesses that were linked to the walnuts. They were distributed at more than 300 food retailers, including Whole Foods Market, New Seasons Market and Rosauers Supermarkets, the F.D.A. said.An investigation is underway to determine the potential source of the contamination, the F.D.A. said. The company did not immediately respond to inquiries on Wednesday.E. coli symptoms can vary from person to person and may include cramping, diarrhea or gastrointestinal distress. Other common symptoms include vomiting and fever. People begin to feel symptoms three to four days after ingesting food or drinks containing the E. coli bacteria, according to the C.D.C.A Whole Foods spokesman said the recalled walnuts were shipped to 10 of their Whole Foods Market stores across Arkansas, Louisiana and Texas and used only as an ingredient in a salad offered on salad bars in those stores. The salad item was removed from the salad bars and the recalled walnuts were destroyed immediately, the spokesman said.",By Johnny Diaz,2024-05-01 16:16:31-04:00,business,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/01/business/walnuts-recall-ecoli-whole-foods.html,The New York Times
38,Florida’s Abortion Ban Will Reach Well Beyond Florida,"       August 2021     Miles to nearest clinic offering abortions after 6 weeks  50150250350450 Source: Caitlin Myers, Middlebury College     As of Wednesday, Florida has banned abortion after six weeks of pregnancy. It will have far-reaching effects.  In 2021, abortion was legal in every state, and the average American woman lived less than 25 miles from a clinic.  But after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, some states banned all or most abortions, including many in the South.  Florida, North Carolina and Virginia were the only states in the South offering abortion after six weeks of pregnancy. For 6.4 million women, the nearest clinic was in Florida.  Now, that option is gone. Women in several states will need to travel hundreds of miles farther to reach a clinic.      It is the biggest change to abortion access since the period immediately after the reversal of Roe v. Wade in 2022.“This is a seismic event for everyone in the ecosystem,” said Jenny Black, the chief executive of Planned Parenthood South Atlantic, which operates in North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia and West Virginia. “It is impossible to overstate the impact of this ban on abortion access in the whole Southeast, probably all up the Eastern Seaboard.”Florida, unlike much of the South, has long had many abortion clinics — more than 50, spread throughout the state. The average Florida woman lives less than 20 miles from one. Last year, clinics in Florida provided around 86,000 abortions, behind only California, New York and Illinois, according to estimates from the Guttmacher Institute.Of those, more than 9,000 were for patients who came from other states, part of an influx after many Southern states banned or severely restricted abortion following the Supreme Court’s decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization.With few exceptions, women across the South who are beyond six weeks of pregnancy — before many women know they’re pregnant — will now have to travel much farther to a clinic for an abortion. Also, for around a decade, Florida has required two appointments 24 hours apart to get an abortion, making it harder to receive one before the six-week mark. In other states, six-week bans have decreased abortions by about half.“We’re hopeful that not only will the numbers in Florida for abortions take a deep nosedive, but also it does have national implications,” said Andrew Shirvell, the founder and executive director of Florida Voice for the Unborn, a group that lobbied the Legislature for the ban. Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican, has said he does not want the state to remain an “abortion tourism destination.”Despite bans in 14 states, and restrictions in several others, the number of legal abortions nationwide is about the same as before Roe was overturned. Florida’s new ban could change that, researchers said — an illustration of how regional abortion access has become. Shutting down abortion access in one linchpin state, Florida, could reduce the number of abortions across the entire region, while in swaths of the rest of the country, abortion has remained accessible, and in some places has even become more so.The maps above show how the distances to the nearest clinic have increased for women in the South who are more than six weeks pregnant, based on data from Caitlin Myers, a professor of economics at Middlebury College, who has been measuring the effects of abortion bans for years.Women in Miami who are beyond six weeks will now need to travel more than 700 miles to reach the nearest clinics — in Charlotte, N.C., where state law requires two visits spread over three days. The current wait time there is a week or more to get an appointment, according to a recent survey of clinics led by Professor Myers. Otherwise, women would need to travel farther, to clinics in Virginia or Washington, D.C.Driving distances would also increase by more than 100 miles for women in parts of Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana and Mississippi.   Percent of women in the South living less than 100 miles from a clinic offering abortions after 6 weeks In August 2021  93% In March 2024  38% With Florida ban  21%   Percent of women in the South living more than 300 miles from a clinic offering abortions after 6 weeks In August 2021  <1% In March 2024  35% With Florida ban  57%      Includes Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas and Virginia. Measurements are for women of reproductive age. Source: Caitlin Myers, Middlebury College   “This is going to be the biggest change to abortion access since Dobbs, and the impact is clear: More people are going to have to travel further distances if they have the financial resources to do so, and many people will be forced to remain pregnant,” said Stephanie Loraine Piñeiro, executive director of Florida Access Network, which helps women in Florida pay for abortions and travel to clinics.Clinic operators in North Carolina and Virginia say they are trying to expand capacity, but are already struggling to meet demand. Several clinics in those states are already reporting waits of two weeks for appointments, according to Professor Myers’s survey and interviews with clinic staffers.Decades of research show that, as driving distances to abortion clinics increase, fewer women obtain abortions. The typical seeker of an abortion is poor, and often struggles to arrange transportation, time off from work, housing and child care to travel long distances.Driving Distances Now     Miles to nearest clinic offering abortions after 6 weeks  50150250350450 Source: Caitlin Myers, Middlebury College  Yet there is uncertainty about the precise long-term effects of the ban. The same day the Florida Supreme Court allowed the six-week limit to go into effect, it also allowed a constitutional amendment on abortion to appear on the November ballot. If the amendment earns the support of 60 percent of voters, it will reverse the ban and protect abortion rights until about 24 weeks.And in recent months, more women have been ordering abortion pills through telemedicine. This includes women in states with bans, who order from clinicians in states with laws that shield them from out-of-state prosecution.Such abortions could become more common in the South. But some women are unaware of the option or uncomfortable managing an abortion without a nearby medical provider. Others are too far along in their pregnancies for the option — abortion pills are recommended by the Food and Drug Administration only during the first 10 weeks of pregnancy.As a result, telemedicine is unlikely to replace all the abortions currently occurring in Florida. “I don’t think it means that everybody just perfectly substitutes it for traveling to a brick and mortar facility and seeing a provider in person,” Professor Myers said.

39,"When My Mom Got Sick, This TV Show Kept Us Going","Every family has its archetypes, so here’s mine: My dad and my brother and I are all miserable. None of us are quick to experience joy, and all for different reasons — my dad is irritable, my brother is anxious and I’m bitter. The three of us combined could make one moderately unwell person. Instead, we are planets that orbit a sun more optimistic than we could ever be, and we hope that some of that shine rubs off on us periodically.My mother believes in a positive ethos: that things invariably will improve, that everyone is trying their best, that it’s better to be surprised by harm than anticipating it all the time. In April 2023, I was laid off from my job, and she reassured me immediately. “Everything always works out,” she said. But for the first time, I noticed a slash of worry run across her face. It looked as if she was losing her radiance.I later learned that my mother had been hiding something important from my brother and me for a month: She’d had a biopsy to determine if she had breast cancer. Within weeks of her 69th birthday, she had a lumpectomy. The doctors told her she would need an exhausting surgery, and then exhaustive radiation. For a little under a year, she went through treatment, and steadily she changed — she became sour, nihilistic and impenetrably dark, just like the rest of us. I had never seen it before, and I didn’t know what to do with it other than try to change her mind. Who was this woman? Every few weeks I’d fly home to find my mother again.Cancer robbed my mom of most pleasures. Food was rendered tasteless at best and inedible at worst; she’d push a plate of cheese and crackers away like a child, pantomiming vomiting at every meal. Radiation gave her brain fog, so it was challenging for her to follow along in a book or a movie. She didn’t find anything on TV funny anymore. She didn’t find me very funny either. She was morose and weepy no matter what the day looked like. In her displeasure, she found only blips of joy. Rummy after lunch, a heating pad on the breast, wearing a mastectomy bra that I lied about and said was given to me free in order to avoid arguing about the cost. But nothing brought her consistent pleasure like the Hindi version of “American Idol.” New episodes aired twice a week, and we would record it and watch after dinner. Only during “Indian Idol” was she upright, eyes peeled, singing along. I was grateful for the absence of conflict. We tuned in to a world where everyone was a winner.Having just wrapped its 14th season, “Indian Idol” has been on since 2004 and has aired 179 episodes. On the South Asian TV channel my parents paid a premium for (“This,” I used to grumble as a kid, “but not Cartoon Network?”), reruns seemed to play daily, for months. “How come no one is getting kicked off?” I asked my mom after seeing the same contestants on the show for three weeks straight. “Oh, it takes a while,” she said, which was a big deal. It was always a big deal when she spoke at all. “Everyone always seems to get the same number of votes.”",By Scaachi Koul,2024-05-01 05:02:38-04:00,magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/01/magazine/indian-idol-cancer.html,The New York Times
40,Even Celebrities Don’t Know How to Ask Their Friends About Ozempic,"On Monday, the actress Melissa McCarthy posted a photo to Instagram in which she was wearing a tiered, sea-foam-green gown at a gala she had attended alongside the director Adam Shankman. Though the photo itself didn’t cause much of a stir, one comment — which happened to be from the entertainer Barbra Streisand — did. It read, in part, “Did you take Ozempic?”Screenshots of the comment began circulating soon after, with many viewers criticizing Ms. Streisand for inquiring publicly whether another celebrity was taking a weight-loss medication. (Others wondered if Ms. Streisand realized the comment had been posted where others could see it.) The comment has since been deleted.On Tuesday afternoon, Ms. Streisand addressed the pushback. She had gone on Instagram to see photos of flowers she had received for her birthday, she wrote in a post on her Instagram and X accounts. “Below them was a photo of my friend Melissa McCarthy who I sang with on my Encore album,” Ms. Streisand wrote. “She looked fantastic! I just wanted to pay her a compliment. I forgot the world is reading!”Ozempic is part of a relatively new class of medications, used in treating diabetes and obesity, that have surged in popularity in recent years. While it is approved by the Food and Drug Administration only for diabetes, people have increasingly been using Ozempic off-label to lose weight. Researchers are investigating whether these medications can treat a range of other conditions, including sleep apnea, alcohol use disorder and chronic kidney disease.ImageMelissa McCarthy with the director Adam Shankman at a theater group’s gala on Sunday.Credit...Alberto E. Rodriguez/Getty ImagesAs the drugs have grown in popularity, so has the stress around social etiquette and whether it is proper to ask your thinner-seeming friends if they are using them. For celebrities, the questions are even more fraught. Some stars have made an event out of revealing they take medication — perhaps none more notably than Oprah Winfrey, who announced in People magazine that she was taking a weight loss drug and “done with the shaming.” She later hosted a prime-time special devoted to weight stigma and the new medications. Elon Musk was one of the earliest proponents, writing on Twitter in 2022 after being asked how he had become so “fit, ripped & healthy” that he was taking another drug, Wegovy.",By Callie Holtermann and Dani Blum,2024-04-30 20:16:54-04:00,style,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/30/style/ozempic-barbra-streisand-melissa-mccarthy.html,The New York Times
41,Justice Dept. Recommends Easing Restrictions on Marijuana,"The Justice Department said on Tuesday that it had recommended easing restrictions on marijuana in what could amount to a major change in federal policy.Even though the move, which kicks off a lengthy rule-making process, does not end the criminalization of the drug, it is a significant shift in how the government views the safety and use of marijuana for medical purposes. It also reflects the Biden administration’s effort to liberalize marijuana policy in a way that puts it more in line with the public as increasingly more Americans favor legalizing the drug.The decision comes at an opportune time for President Biden, who is trailing the presumptive Republican nominee, former President Donald J. Trump, as they approach the November election, according to a recent CNN poll.It could also lead to the softening of other laws and regulations that account for the use or possession of cannabis, including sentencing guidelines, banking and access to public housing.People familiar with the recommendation, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said Attorney General Merrick B. Garland planned to tell the White House Office of Management and Budget that the government should change the drug’s categorization. After the office assesses the recommendation, it will still face a long road before taking effect, including being subject to public comment.The Associated Press earlier reported the Justice Department decision.For more than half a century, marijuana has been considered a Schedule I drug, classified on the same level as highly addictive substances like heroin that the Drug Enforcement Administration describes as having no currently accepted medical use. Moving marijuana to Schedule III, as the Department of Health and Human Services recommended in August, would put it alongside less addictive substances like Tylenol with codeine, ketamine and testosterone, meaning that it would be subject to fewer restrictions on production and research, and that eventually it could be prescribed by a doctor.","By Eileen Sullivan, Glenn Thrush and Zolan Kanno-Youngs",2024-04-30 15:01:56-04:00,us,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/30/us/politics/justice-department-reclassify-marijuana.html,The New York Times
42,Walmart Is Shutting Health Centers After Plan to Expand,"Walmart, the world’s largest retailer, said Tuesday that it was shutting down its health care centers, a network that only last year it said it planned to expand.The retailer said in a blog post that its 51 health centers across five states would close. The centers were next to Supercenter locations. The plans won’t affect the more than 4,600 pharmacies and more than 3,000 vision centers within Walmart stores.Walmart started the health clinic initiative in 2019 in Dallas, Ga., with centers providing primary care, labs, X-rays and electrocardiograms, counseling, and dental, optical and hearing services. Many were in smaller towns where customers might lack access to quality care, and the company had said it was focused on affordability. In 2021, Walmart started offering a virtual option when it acquired MeMD, a telehealth provider.“This is a difficult decision, and like others, the challenging reimbursement environment and escalating operating costs create a lack of profitability that make the care business unsustainable for us at this time,” the company said Tuesday.Walmart said it was still deciding when it would close each center. In addition to Georgia, centers are in Arkansas, Florida, Illinois and Texas. Workers within the centers will be paid for 90 days and will be eligible to transfer to other Walmart or Sam’s Club locations, the company said.Offering health care is more difficult than selling consumer goods like laundry detergent and car parts, said David Silverman, a retail analyst at Fitch Ratings, noting the layers of government and insurance providers involved.“The attempts to enter these spaces and some of the failures of doing so really underscore the challenges and complexities of operating in the U.S. health care space,” Mr. Silverman said.In March 2023, Walmart said it planned to double its health center locations. It said that by the end of 2024, it expected to have more than 75 Walmart Health Centers and expand to states like Missouri and Arizona.In 2021, Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan Chase ended their high-profile joint health care venture, which sought to explore new ways to deliver health care to their employees. In March, Walgreens said it had closed 140 of its VillageMD clinics and planned to close 20 more.Jordyn Holman is a business reporter for The Times, covering the retail industry and consumer behavior.

43,An Intimate Look at Modern Love and Marriage,"Times Insider explains who we are and what we do and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.When Amanda Montei began reporting an article last year about married couples who had little to no sex, she didn’t know how forthcoming people would be about their sex lives.But to her surprise, many of the couples were willing — grateful, even — to talk about it.“It was almost like a pressure valve was released,” Ms. Montei said of her conversations with more than 30 married people who are among the 50 percent of American adults having sex once a month or less. “Most couples I talked with said speaking to me felt like a relief because they were able to talk openly about their sexual lives without judgment.”The article, which was published this month in the Modern Love issue of The New York Times Magazine, is based on phone and video conversations with couples in seven states, as well as Canada, Britain and Italy, and took Ms. Montei five months to report.“My main takeaway was that there are so many factors that influence a person’s desire,” she said. “It’s a really complicated negotiation with the self and the body and our current cultural moment.”In a phone conversation from her home in the San Francisco Bay Area, Ms. Montei discussed how she helped sources feel comfortable sharing intimate details of their private lives and what questions she hopes to tackle next in her reporting. These are edited excerpts.How did you come up with the idea for this article?I published a book last fall about motherhood and sexuality and received lots of notes from readers who connected with it and saw themselves represented in it, and who found that motherhood impacted the way they viewed their bodies, sexual lives and relationships. Writing and publishing the book made me more curious about women’s sexual lives, especially how desires can change with age and parenthood; what marriage has tended to demand of women; and how people in long-term heterosexual relationships navigate those changes today.",By Sarah Bahr,2024-04-30 03:00:22-04:00,insider,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/30/insider/sexless-marriage.html,The New York Times
44,Philips Settles CPAP Breathing Device Lawsuits for $1.1 Billion,"Philips Respironics has reached a $1.1 billion settlement over claims that people who used their CPAP and other breathing devices were harmed by noxious gasses and flecks of foam that lodged in their airways, sometimes for years.Thousands of people contended in lawsuits that they had been injured by popular Philips DreamStation machines. The settlement affects CPAP, or continuous positive airway pressure, machines that people with sleep apnea or other respiratory difficulties use at night to improve their breathing, as well as other types of machines used at home and in hospitals.Philips did not admit any fault in the settlement, including whether the devices caused the injuries, according to a financial report issued Monday.The personal injury settlement follows a $479 million settlement reached in September over economic losses to the patients and medical equipment sales companies that financed replacement devices. Philips also agreed to a consent decree earlier this year that forced the company to halt U.S. sales of new devices until certain conditions are met.Monday’s agreement largely settles years of litigation over a problem that was deeply upsetting to patients and doctors, who had to weigh the risk of letting patients’ interrupted breathing go untreated against the use of a machine that might cause harm. Patients flooded lawmakers and the Food and Drug Administration with complaints about a chaotic recall and replacement effort that left many waiting for months or more than a year for an updated device.In a letter to Philips in May 2022, the F.D.A. noted that the company had received reports about the problem as early as 2015, but failed to evaluate the information and address the device’s problems.The recall started in the summer of 2021 amid concerns that the machines blew out potentially cancer-causing gases. The initial recall affected about 15 million breathing machines produced since 2006, though roughly five million were still in circulation in mid-2021.The F.D.A. reported earlier this year that since Philips first warned of the problems, officials had received 116,000 complaints, including 561 reports of deaths, that people or lawyers said were linked to the faulty foam in the device.The company has since tempered its warnings, saying that further testing showed that the gasses were not as toxic as initially believed.Investors recognized the resolution, as the company stock surged by about 33 percent Monday morning, to about $28 per share. The company said that part of the settlement would be covered by insurance.Plaintiffs’ lawyers welcomed the settlement.“Ultimately, these combined agreements accomplish what we sought to achieve when this litigation began — holding Philips accountable by obtaining care for those with physical injuries and compensation for those needing new respiratory devices,” Sandra L. Duggan, Kelly K. Iverson and Christopher A. Seeger, lawyers representing the plaintiffs, said in a statement.Christina Jewett covers the Food and Drug Administration, which means keeping a close eye on drugs, medical devices, food safety and tobacco policy.

45,How Supplement Stores Are Trying to Tap Into the Ozempic Boom,"As diabetes and weight-loss drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy took off in the last few years, many people turned away from established diet and nutrition products.Now, two retailers that specialize in nutritional supplements — GNC and the Vitamin Shoppe — are trying new approaches to win over people who are taking those drugs or who are interested in them.GNC is dedicating a wall of supplements in its more than 2,300 stores to products that it believes will appeal to people on Ozempic, which contains the compound semaglutide, and other drugs that are known as GLP-1 medicines. The chain is also training workers to help customers assess which substances could help them manage common side effects of those prescription drugs.Michael Costello, chief executive of GNC, said his company saw a “big opening” in helping individuals taking such drugs for weight loss.“As we were looking at the trends with folks, where people are going, Ozempic and obviously Wegovy and other GLP-1s started blowing up,” Mr. Costello said in an interview. “We saw there were significant side effects for a lot of those drugs.”It’s not clear exactly how many Americans are taking Ozempic and similar drugs for weight loss, but Mr. Costello referred to a study from Goldman Sachs that estimates up to 70 million Americans will have tried the medicines by 2028.",By Jordyn Holman,2024-04-29 05:02:49-04:00,business,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/29/business/ozempic-wegovy-gnc-vitamin-shoppe.html,The New York Times
46,U.S. Lags Behind Other Countries in Hepatitis-C Treatment,"In the 10 years since the drugmaker Gilead debuted a revolutionary treatment for hepatitis C, a wave of new therapies have been used to cure millions of people around the world of the blood-borne virus.Today, 15 countries, including Egypt, Canada and Australia, are on track to eliminate hepatitis C during this decade, according to the Center for Disease Analysis Foundation, a nonprofit. Each has pursued a dogged national screening and treatment campaign.But the arsenal of drugs, which have generated tens of billions of dollars for pharmaceutical companies, has not brought the United States any closer to eradicating the disease.Spread through the blood including IV drug use, hepatitis C causes liver inflammation, though people may not display symptoms for years. Only a fraction of Americans with the virus are aware of the infection, even as many develop the fatal disease.A course of medications lasting eight to 12 weeks is straightforward. But the most at-risk, including those who are incarcerated, uninsured or homeless, have difficulty navigating the American health system to get treatment.Of those diagnosed in the United States since 2013, just 34 percent have been cured, according to a recent analysis by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",By Ted Alcorn,2024-04-28 05:00:51-04:00,health,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/28/health/hepatitis-c.html,The New York Times
47,Federal Officials Find No Live Bird Flu Virus in Initial Milk Tests,"Federal regulators on Friday said that they had not yet discovered live bird flu virus in the first batch of retail milk samples they tested, a reassuring indication that the milk on store shelves remains safe despite an outbreak of the virus among dairy cows.In an online update, the Food and Drug Administration said an initial set of tests looking for live virus, not just genetic fragments, suggested that the pasteurization process was effectively neutralizing the pathogen.“These results reaffirm our assessment that the commercial milk supply is safe,” the F.D.A. wrote in the update, adding that the testing efforts were ongoing.Officials also tested infant and toddler formula, which incorporate powdered dairy, and did not find the virus, the agency wrote.The F.D.A. embarked on a national survey of milk samples shortly after an outbreak of the bird flu virus, called H5N1, was discovered among dairy cows. Government scientists have been testing 297 samples of retail dairy products from 38 states, a swath of the country that covers regions far beyond the nine states known to have infected herds.The first type of testing regulators conducted, a form of polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, is relatively speedy, but it picks up only genetic traces of the virus and does not tell researchers whether the live pathogen is present.",By Noah Weiland and Benjamin Mueller,2024-04-26 19:11:49-04:00,health,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/26/health/bird-flu-milk-fda.html,The New York Times
48,Biden Delays Ban on Menthol Cigarettes,"The Biden administration said on Friday that it was delaying a decision on whether to ban menthol cigarettes, effectively quashing a proposal that has divided Black American voters and fueled million-dollar lobbying campaigns from the tobacco industry in this presidential election year.The White House has faced considerable resistance from the cigarette companies that would lose billions of dollars if they could no longer sell menthol cigarettes. Opponents took to the airwaves to warn of a spike in cartel traffic along the border from counterfeit cigarette smuggling and of police violence targeting Black residents if a ban were in force.Those efforts posed risks for President Biden, whose support among Black voters has at times slipped in recent months.Some of Mr. Biden’s top health officials have said that a ban would save lives and protect against lung cancer, which is a higher risk for Black smokers, who have historically favored menthol cigarettes and are heavily targeted by tobacco companies.“This rule has garnered historic attention, and the public comment period has yielded an immense amount of feedback, including from various elements of the civil rights and criminal justice movement,” Xavier Becerra, the health and human services secretary, said in a statement. “It’s clear that there are still more conversations to have, and that will take significantly more time.”The decision highlighted a debate among senior federal officials over how to weigh the political and legal consequences of a ban against public health.",By Christina Jewett and Noah Weiland,2024-04-26 14:42:06-04:00,health,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/26/health/menthol-cigarettes-ban-biden-fda.html,The New York Times
49,At Least Three Women Were Infected With H.I.V. After ‘Vampire Facials’,"At least three women were infected with H.I.V. during cosmetic “vampire facial” procedures at an unlicensed spa in Albuquerque, federal officials said Thursday. It is the first time that H.I.V. transmission through cosmetic injection services has been documented, they said.The three were among a cluster of five people sharing highly similar H.I.V. strains, four of whom had undergone a procedure called platelet-rich plasma microneedling at the spa. The fifth individual, a man, had a sexual relationship with one of the women.Investigators still do not know the precise source of the contamination. A 2018 H.I.V. diagnosis in a patron who reported having no behavioral risk factors led to a public health investigation when the woman said she had received a cosmetic treatment involving needles, called a platelet-rich plasma microneedling facial.An inspection of the spa found unlabeled tubes of blood lying on a kitchen counter, others stored along with food in a refrigerator, and unwrapped syringes in drawers and trash cans.The facility also appeared to be reusing disposable equipment intended for single use only, according to a report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.The report comes on the heels of an announcement by health officials earlier this month that they are investigating a string of illnesses tied to counterfeit or improperly injected Botox containing high amounts of the botulinum toxin, which is used in small doses to smooth wrinkles.",By Roni Caryn Rabin,2024-04-26 09:44:33-04:00,health,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/26/health/hiv-vampire-facial.html,The New York Times
50,Beth Linker Is Turning Good Posture on Its Head,"For decades, the idea of standing properly upright carried considerable political and social baggage. Slouching was considered a sign of decay.In the early 20th century, posture exams became mainstays in the military, the workplace and schools, thanks in part to the American Posture League, a group of physicians, educators and health officials that formed in 1914. In 1917, a study found that roughly 80 percent of Harvard’s freshman class had poor posture. Industrialists piled on with posture-enhancing chairs, products and gadgets.But the actual science doesn’t support the conventional wisdom about proper posture, Beth Linker argues in her new book, “Slouch: Posture Panic in Modern America.” Dr. Linker, a historian and sociologist of science at the University of Pennsylvania, recently sat for an interview with The New York Times; the conversation has been condensed and edited for clarity.Nice to meet you.Your posture looks pretty good. And it doesn’t matter — that’s the whole point of my book. It’s fake news.Our obsession with great posture is fake news? I’m off the hook!Concern for posture, as a matter of etiquette, has been around since the Enlightenment, if not earlier, but poor posture did not become a scientific and medical obsession until after the publication of Darwin’s “On the Origin of Species” in 1859. He posited that humans evolved through natural selection, and that the first thing to develop was bipedalism; in other words, standing upright preceded brain development.This idea was controversial because convention taught that higher intellect distinguished humans from nonhuman animals, and now it appeared that only a mere physical difference, located in the spine and feet, separated humankind from the apes.",By Matt Richtel,2024-04-26 05:01:35-04:00,science,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/26/science/linker-posture-science.html,The New York Times
51,One in Five Milk Samples Nationwide Shows Genetic Traces of Bird Flu,"Federal regulators have discovered fragments of bird flu virus in roughly 20 percent of retail milk samples tested in a nationally representative study, the Food and Drug Administration said in an online update on Thursday.Samples from parts of the country that are known to have dairy herds infected with the virus were more likely to test positive, the agency said. Regulators said that there is no evidence that this milk poses a danger to consumers or that live virus is present in the milk on store shelves, an assessment public health experts have agreed with.But finding traces of the virus in such a high share of samples from around the country is the strongest signal yet that the bird flu outbreak in dairy cows is more extensive than the official tally of 33 infected herds across eight states.“It suggests that there is a whole lot of this virus out there,” said Richard Webby, a virologist and influenza expert at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital.Dr. Webby said that he believed it was still possible to eradicate the virus, which is known as H5N1, from the nation’s dairy farms. But it will be difficult to design effective control measures without knowing the scope of the outbreak, he said.The findings also raise questions about how the virus has evaded detection and where else it might be silently spreading. Some scientists have criticized the federal testing strategy as too limited to reveal the true extent of viral spread.",By Emily Anthes and Noah Weiland,2024-04-25 18:54:02-04:00,health,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/25/health/bird-flu-milk-fda.html,The New York Times
52,"Penny Simkin, ‘Mother of the Doula Movement,’ Dies at 85","Penny Simkin, a childbirth educator and author who was often described as the “mother of the doula movement,” died on April 11 at her home in Seattle. She was 85.The cause was pancreatic cancer, said her daughter, Linny Simkin.Ms. Simkin, a physical therapist turned birth educator, was a pioneer in helping women have a better experience during and after birth. Doula is the Greek word for “female servant,” and it was embraced by alternative birth professionals several decades ago to refer to someone who supports mothers during labor. In books, workshops and training organizations, Ms. Simkin helped popularize that role and worked as a doula herself.Doulas are not medical professionals; their role is to provide comfort to women in the delivery room as well as postpartum care at home. That care might include snacks, massages or warm compresses but also more substantive assistance, like suggesting movements to ease labor pains or help with breastfeeding.Ms. Simkin’s innovations included a device called the squatting bar, which is attached to a hospital bed for the mother to hang onto and squat, a position that opens the pelvis and allows gravity to help with the baby’s delivery.Her work came out of the natural childbirth movement of the 1970s, when alternatives to the standard hospital birth were being explored. But she was agnostic about home versus hospital deliveries and about pain-relieving measures. Her focus, always, was on the mother.Ms. Simkin surveyed thousands of women about their birth experiences, to better train doulas in preparing women for childbirth. “How will she remember this?” she exhorted her students.",By Penelope Green,2024-04-25 17:44:45-04:00,health,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/25/health/penny-simkin-dead.html,The New York Times
53,What You Really Need to Know About Antidepressants,"Antidepressants are among the most prescribed medications in the United States. This is, in part, because the number of people diagnosed with depression and anxiety has been on the rise, and prescriptions jumped sharply among some age groups during the pandemic.Despite the prevalence of these medications, some patients have “significant misconceptions” about how the drugs work, said Dr. Andrew J. Gerber, a psychiatrist and the president and medical director of Silver Hill Hospital in New Canaan, Conn.About 80 percent of antidepressants are prescribed by primary care doctors who have not had extensive training in managing mental illness.Dr. Paul Nestadt, an associate professor of psychiatry at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, said patients tell him, “‘You know, Doc, I’ve tried everything.’” But often, he said, “they never got to a good dose, or they were only on it for a week or two.”Here are some answers to frequently asked questions about antidepressants.How do antidepressants work?There are many types of antidepressants, and they all work a bit differently.In general, they initiate a change in the way brain cells — and different regions of the brain — communicate with one another, said Dr. Gerard Sanacora, a professor of psychiatry at the Yale School of Medicine.",By Christina Caron,2024-04-25 05:03:29-04:00,well,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/25/well/mind/antidepressants-side-effects-anxiety-stress.html,The New York Times
54,F.D.A. Approves Antibiotic for Increasingly Hard-to-Treat Urinary Tract Infections,"The Food and Drug Administration on Wednesday approved the sale of an antibiotic for the treatment of urinary tract infections in women, giving U.S. health providers a powerful new tool to combat a common infection that is increasingly unresponsive to the existing suite of antimicrobial drugs.The drug, pivmecillinam, has been used in Europe for more than 40 years, where it is often a first-line therapy for women with uncomplicated U.T.I.’s, meaning the infection is confined to the bladder and has not reached the kidneys. The drug will be marketed in the U.S. as Pivya and will be made available by prescription to women 18 and older.It is the first time in two decades that the F.D.A. has approved a new antibiotic for U.T.I.s, which annually affect 30 million Americans. U.T.I.s are responsible for the single-greatest use of antibiotics outside a hospital setting.“Uncomplicated U.T.I.s are a very common condition impacting women and one of the most frequent reasons for antibiotic use,” Dr. Peter Kim, director of the Division of Anti-Infectives at the F.D.A.’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, said in a statement. “The F.D.A. is committed to fostering new antibiotic availability when they prove to be safe and effective.”Utility Therapeutics, the U.S. company that acquired the rights to pivmecillinam, said it would be available in 2025. The company is also seeking F.D.A. approval for an intravenous version of the drug that is used for more serious infections and is usually administered in a hospital setting.Health practitioners said they were elated to have another tool in their arsenal given the growing challenge of antimicrobial resistance, which makes existing medications less effective as pathogens mutate in ways that allow them to survive a course of antibiotics.",By Andrew Jacobs,2024-04-24 16:27:42-04:00,health,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/24/health/fda-urinary-tract-infection-antibiotic.html,The New York Times
55,5 Takeaways From the Supreme Court Arguments on Idaho’s Abortion Ban,"The abortion case before the Supreme Court on Wednesday featured vigorous questioning and comments, particularly by the three liberal justices. At issue is whether Idaho’s near-total ban on abortion is so strict that it violates a federal law requiring emergency care for any patient, including providing abortions for pregnant women in dire situations.A ruling could reverberate beyond Idaho, to at least half a dozen other states that have similarly restrictive bans.The implications of the case could also extend beyond abortion, including whether states can legally restrict other types of emergency medical care and whether the federal law opens the door for claims of fetal personhood.Here are some takeaways:The case centers on whether Idaho’s abortion ban violates federal law.Idaho’s ban allows abortion to save the life of a pregnant woman, but not to prevent her health from deteriorating. The federal government says it therefore violates the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act, or EMTALA, which was enacted nearly 40 years ago.EMTALA says that when a patient goes to an emergency room with an urgent medical issue, hospitals must either provide treatment to stabilize the patient or transfer the patient to a medical facility that can, regardless of the patient’s ability to pay. It says that if a state law conflicts with the federal law, the federal law takes precedence.A lawyer representing Idaho, Joshua Turner, told the Supreme Court that the state does not believe its abortion ban conflicts with the federal law. He said the ban allows emergency departments to provide abortions if a pregnant woman has a medical problem that is likely to lead to her death, not just if she is facing imminent death.",By Pam Belluck,2024-04-24 15:19:54-04:00,us,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/24/us/politics/supreme-court-idaho-abortion-law.html,The New York Times
56,Dairy Cows Transported Between States Must Now Be Tested for Bird Flu,"The Biden administration on Wednesday said that it would begin requiring dairy cows moving across state lines to be tested for bird flu, which has been spreading in herds for months. The new policy is part of a growing effort to stamp out the spread of a virus that federal health officials have sought to reassure Americans poses little risk to people so far.The new order, issued by the Department of Agriculture, says that lactating cows must test negative for influenza A viruses, a class that includes bird flu, before they are transported. The owners of herds with positive tests will need to provide data on the movements of the cattle to help investigators trace the disease.The testing will help protect the livestock industry, limit the spread of the virus and “better understand this disease,” Mike Watson, a senior Department of Agriculture official, told reporters in a press briefing Wednesday morning.Since a highly contagious form of bird flu was detected in the United States in 2022, federal officials have sought to reassure Americans that the threat to the public remained low, even as the virus infected a growing number of mammals. Federal regulators on Tuesday announced that inactive viral fragments had been found in pasteurized milk, a suggestion that the virus was likely spreading much more widely among cattle than previously known.Dr. Nirav Shah, the principal deputy director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told reporters on Wednesday that there were no changes in the genetic makeup of the virus that would allow it to spread easily among people. So far, Dr. Shah said, states have been monitoring 44 people who were exposed to the virus and are being monitored for infection.As of Wednesday, the outbreak had spread to 33 herds in eight states, according to the U.S.D.A. But just one human infection has been reported, in a dairy worker in Texas who had direct contact with sick cows. The case was mild.","By Noah Weiland, Benjamin Mueller and Emily Anthes",2024-04-24 14:14:45-04:00,health,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/24/health/bird-flu-dairy-cows-testing-usda.html,The New York Times
57,Grandmother Becomes Second Patient to Receive Kidney From Gene-Edited Pig,"A severely ill 54-year-old woman earlier this month became the second person to receive a kidney transplanted from a genetically modified pig, surgeons at NYU Langone Health in New York announced on Wednesday.The patient, who had both heart failure and kidney failure, was given the organ on April 12, just eight days after receiving a mechanical heart pump. Surgical teams at NYU Langone carried out the two procedures over the course of nine days.The kidney recipient, Lisa Pisano, a native of New Jersey, was at risk of dying without the heart pump, a medical device used in patients who need a heart transplant.The kidney came from a genetically engineered pig provided by United Therapeutics Corporation, a biotech company. The pig carried a gene for producing a sugar called alpha-gal that had been “knocked out,” or blocked.NYU Langone Health studies have shown that removing the gene reduces the risk of a severe immune reaction in a patient, which can lead to the immediate rejection of an organ transplanted from an animal, a process called xenotransplantation.The NYU Langone surgeons also placed the pig’s thymus gland, which can reprogram the patient’s immune system so it doesn’t reject the pig’s organ, under the transplanted kidney in order to reduce the likelihood of rejection.",By Roni Caryn Rabin,2024-04-24 13:32:00-04:00,health,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/24/health/kidney-transplant-pig.html,The New York Times
58,New Nutrition Guidelines Put Less Sugar and Salt on the Menu for School Meals,"School meals will soon contain less salt and sugar, but can still include chocolate milk, under new nutrition guidelines released by the Biden administration.The Agriculture Department announced on Wednesday that it had finalized the regulation it had first proposed in February 2023, having weakened several provisions after feedback from food companies, school nutrition professionals and over 136,000 public comments.“All of this is designed to ensure that students have quality meals and that we meet parents’ expectation that their children are receiving healthy and nutritious meals at school,” Tom Vilsack, the agriculture secretary, said in a call with reporters on Tuesday.The new guidelines seek to better align school meals with federal dietary standards and build on a 2010 law that aimed to make cafeteria breakfasts and lunches healthier. That law, championed by Michelle Obama when she was the first lady, became embroiled in political debate almost immediately. The Trump administration tried repeatedly to roll back nutrition standards, and the Biden administration relaxed certain provisions to provide more flexibility during the coronavirus pandemic.About 28.6 million students received or purchased lunch through the national school lunch program in the 2023 fiscal year, and the school lunch and breakfast programs cost the federal government about $21 billion.When the Agriculture Department proposed updates to the standards last year, school nutrition professionals called the guidelines unrealistic to enforce, and dairy groups expressed concerns over what they called a push to limit milk. The final rule reflects some of those concerns.",By Linda Qiu,2024-04-24 08:30:09-04:00,us,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/24/us/politics/school-meals-nutrition.html,The New York Times
59,Rishi Sunak’s Dismal Task: Leading U.K. Conservatives to Likely Defeat,"Updated 10:03 a.m. ETA few days before Britain’s Conservative Party suffered a stinging setback in local elections on Thursday, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak recorded a short video to promote some good news from his government. In the eight-second clip, Mr. Sunak poured milk from a pint bottle into a tall glass, filled with a steaming dark beverage and bearing the scribbled figure of 900 pounds on the side.“Pay day is coming,” Mr. Sunak posted, referring to the savings that an average wage earner would supposedly reap from a cut in mandatory contributions to Britain’s national insurance system.The mockery soon started. He’d added too much milk, some said. His numbers didn’t add up, said others. And why, asked one critic, would Mr. Sunak choose a pint bottle as a prop days after the opposition Labour Party’s deputy leader, Angela Rayner, had skewered him in Parliament as a “pint-size loser?”However partisan her jab, loser is a label that Mr. Sunak is finding increasingly hard to shake, even among his members of his own party. In the 18 months since he replaced his failed predecessor, Liz Truss, Mr. Sunak, 43, has lost seven special parliamentary elections and back-to-back local elections.This past week’s local elections, in which the Conservatives lost about 40 percent of the 985 seats they were defending, were merely the latest signpost on what analysts say is a road to thumping defeat in a general election. National polls show the Labour Party leading the Conservatives by more than 20 percentage points, a stubborn gap that the prime minister has been unable to close.The drumbeat of bad news is casting fresh scrutiny on Mr. Sunak’s leadership and the future of his party, which has been in power for 14 years but faces what could be a long stretch in the political wilderness.",By Mark Landler,2024-05-04 09:31:02-04:00,world,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/04/world/europe/uk-rishi-sunak-conservatives-elections.html,The New York Times
60,Family Values or Fighting Valor? Russia Grapples With Women’s Wartime Role.,"Updated 9:12 a.m. ETThe Russian Army is gradually expanding the role of women as it seeks to balance President Vladimir V. Putin’s promotion of traditional family roles with the need for new recruits for the war in Ukraine.The military’s stepped-up appeal to women includes efforts to recruit female inmates in prisons, replicating on a much smaller scale a strategy that has swelled its ranks with male convicts. Recruiters in military uniforms toured Russian jails for women in the fall of 2023, offering inmates a pardon and $2,000 a month — 10 times the national minimum wage — in return for serving in frontline roles for a year, according to six current and former inmates of three prisons in different regions of Russia.Dozens of inmates just from those prisons have signed military contracts or applied to enlist, the women said, a sampling that — along with local media reports about recruitment in other regions — suggests a broader effort to enlist female convicts.It’s not just convicts. Women now feature in Russian military recruitment advertisements across the country. A pro-Kremlin paramilitary unit fighting in Ukraine also recruits women.“Combat experience and military specialties are not required,” read an advertisement aimed at women that was posted in March in Russia’s Tatarstan region. It offered training and a sign-up bonus equivalent to $4,000. “We have one goal — victory!”",By Anatoly Kurmanaev and Ekaterina Bodyagina,2024-05-04 04:10:58-04:00,world,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/04/world/europe/russia-soldiers-women.html,The New York Times
61,"The Bleak Life of a Deposed President and His Wife, Held Captive","Held captive by his former security guards in an isolated wing of his house, the deposed president of Niger paces a bedroom with no direct daylight, cut off from the world and unable to talk to his lawyers, according to people with direct knowledge of the conditions of his detention.Nine months since he was toppled in one of the coups that have recently wracked West Africa, Mohamed Bazoum is lingering in detention with no end in sight. The military junta that deposed him is seeking to strip him of presidential immunity, paving the way for him to be prosecuted on charges such as treason, for which the penalty could be life imprisonment, his lawyers said.Trapped with his wife, Hadiza, and two domestic workers, he has no access to a phone and is not allowed to see his lawyers, other family members or friends, according to members of his inner circle who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the precariousness of the situation. His only visitor is a doctor, who brings him food once a week.The once-loud calls for his release have grown quiet. Many of Mr. Bazoum’s closest allies — his cabinet members and advisers — have been thrown into jail or forced to flee Niger.And some of Mr. Bazoum’s closest international partners are backing away. At the demand of the governing junta, the United States is preparing to withdraw about 1,000 troops stationed at an air base in the country’s desert. France, a longtime partner in the fight against extremist groups affiliated with Al Qaeda and the Islamic State, departed in December.Instead, about 100 Russian military instructors arrived in the capital, Niamey, in April as Niger’s new leaders turned to Moscow for security assistance.",By Elian Peltier,2024-05-04 05:01:11-04:00,world,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/04/world/africa/niger-bazoum-captivity.html,The New York Times
62,"Drones Changed This Civil War, and Linked Rebels to the World","TIn flip-flops and shorts, one of the finest soldiers in a resistance force battling the military junta in Myanmar showed off his weaponry. It was, he apologized, mostly in pieces.The rebel, Ko Shan Gyi, glued panels of plastic shaped by a 3D printer. Nearby, electrical innards foraged from Chinese-made drones used for agricultural purposes were arrayed on the ground, their wires exposed as if awaiting surgery.Other parts needed to construct homemade drones, including chunks of Styrofoam studded with propellers, crowded a pair of leaf-walled shacks. Together, they could somewhat grandly be considered the armory of the Karenni Nationalities Defense Force. A laser cutter was poised halfway through carving out a flight control unit. The generator powering the workshop had quit. It wasn’t clear when there would be electricity again.Despite the ragtag conditions, rebel drone units have managed to upend the power balance in Myanmar. By most measures, the military that wrested power from a civilian administration in Myanmar three years ago is far bigger and better equipped than the hundreds of militias fighting to reclaim the country. The junta has at its disposal Russian fighter jets and Chinese missiles.But with little more than instructions crowdsourced online and parts ordered from China, the resistance forces have added ballast to what might seem a hopelessly asymmetrical civil war. The techniques they are using would not be unfamiliar to soldiers in Ukraine, Yemen or Sudan.

63,Police Arrest 3 in Slaying of Sikh Leader That Shocked Canada,"Three Indian men were charged in the brazen slaying of a Sikh separatist on Canadian soil, the police said on Friday, a killing that set off a diplomatic clash with New Delhi after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau blamed “agents of the government of India” for orchestrating the shooting.India’s government called the claim “absurd” and took steps that led Canada to withdraw more than 40 of its diplomats from the country. But amid the denials, Canada said it had a “smoking gun,” supported by information from the United States. And a federal indictment in New York linked the Indian government to another murder-for-hire-plot against another Sikh separatist.The three men were arrested in Edmonton, Alberta, and charged with first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder in the killing of the Sikh nationalist, Hardeep Singh Nijjar, in June, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police said. The suspects — Karan Brar, 22; Kamalpreet Singh, 22; and Karanpreet Singh, 28 — had been living in Canada for three to five years but were not permanent residents of Canada, the police said.“This investigation does not end here,” Superintendent Mandeep Mooker, head of the Integrated Homicide Investigation Team for the Mounties, said at a news conference on Friday. “We are aware that others may have played a role in this homicide, and we remain dedicated to finding and arresting each one of these individuals.”ImageSuperintendent Mandeep Mooker of the Mounties, speaking at a news conference on Friday, said the investigation was ongoing.Credit...Ethan Cairns/The Canadian Press, via Associated PressSeveral other investigations are ongoing, including into any possible involvement by the Indian government in Mr. Nijjar’s killing, Assistant Commissioner David Teboul said at the news conference.

They have not contacted us,” she pleaded to the more than 120,000 members of a community Facebook page created for people interested in touring Mexico’s Baja California peninsula.She added that Callum was a Type 1 diabetic.The state’s attorney general, María Elena Andrade Ramírez, said in a news conference on Thursday that prosecutors were investigating three people related to the case but that crucial time had passed since the disappearance of the three men.“Unfortunately, it wasn’t until the last few days that they were reported missing,” Ms. Andrade Ramírez told reporters. “So, that meant that important hours or time was lost.” ",By Emiliano Rodríguez Mega,2024-05-03 21:59:12-04:00,world,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/03/world/americas/mexico-missing-surfers.html,The New York Times
65,"Israel, Gaza and the Law on Starvation in War","Updated 8:47 a.m. ETOn March 19, Volker Türk, the United Nations’ human rights chief, said in an official statement that Israel’s policies regarding aid in Gaza might amount to a war crime.“The extent of Israel’s continued restrictions on the entry of aid into Gaza, together with the manner in which it continues to conduct hostilities, may amount to the use of starvation as a method of war, which is a war crime,” he wrote.His comments made waves. Using starvation of civilians as a weapon is a serious violation of international humanitarian law, and a war crime under the Rome Statute, the treaty of the International Criminal Court, or I.C.C.Israeli and foreign officials told The New York Times last week that they were worried that the I.C.C. was preparing to issue arrest warrants against senior Israeli officials — including potentially over accusations that they prevented the delivery of aid to civilians in Gaza. (They also said they believed that the court was considering arrest warrants for Hamas leaders, which could be issued concurrently.)Let me be clear: There is a high evidentiary bar for war-crime prosecutions, and we have no way of knowing at this stage what a full investigation would reveal, particularly because independent observers have had limited access to Gaza.We do know that a humanitarian crisis is underway in the enclave and that the specter of famine has loomed increasingly close in recent weeks. And in remarks released on Friday from an upcoming “Meet the Press” interview, Cindy McCain, the director of the World Food Program, said that parts of northern Gaza were now experiencing a “full-blown famine.”",By Amanda Taub,2024-05-04 00:01:02-04:00,world,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/04/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-starvation-icc.html,The New York Times
66,Panama’s 2024 Election: What to Know,"Leer en españolWhy does this election matter?Who is running?What are the main issues?Who is expected to win?When will we learn the result?Where can I find more information?Why does this election matter?Political crisis has embroiled Panama’s May 5 presidential election, exacerbating uncertainty in a country dealing with drought and fallout from widespread protests.Former President Ricardo Martinelli, who had appeared in polls as the front-runner, was disqualified from running after he received a 10-year sentence for money laundering. Panama’s Electoral Tribunal has allowed his running mate, a former public security minister named José Raúl Mulino, to take his place. Mr. Martinelli claims he is being politically persecuted.Mr. Martinelli governed Panama during a period of strong economic growth and was popular despite his conviction. Mr. Mulino seems to have inherited his following. The result is a paradox: Although Panamanians see corruption as one of the country’s most pressing problems, they have also shown the highest support for Mr. Mulino, who strongly backs Mr. Martinelli.The election takes place amid wide frustration with the political establishment. The current president, Laurentino Cortizo, from Panama’s largest political party, is extremely unpopular and has weathered corruption scandals. His administration drew enormous protests, with Panamanians paralyzing the country in 2023 to oppose a copper-mining contract that critics said would endanger the environment.Political conflicts and social upheaval have affected the climate for foreign investment, an area that Panama relies on heavily. In March, Fitch Ratings downgraded Panama’s credit rating, citing the government’s closing of the mine after the protests. Growth of the country’s gross domestic product is expected to decline to 2.5 percent in 2024 from 7.5 percent in 2023 as a result of the closure, according to the International Monetary Fund.Who is running?Eight candidates are competing for a five-year term in a single-round vote. Panama does not permit incumbent presidents to run for a second consecutive term. Panama is also choosing its representatives on the National Assembly and in local governments.

Scenes from the protests — and of the arrests of protesters — have been top news around the world from Bogotá to Berlin, Tehran to Paris.In some countries, including France, students have staged protests of their own, though not with the scale and intensity of those in the United States.Some applaud the protests. Others, particularly in countries ruled by authoritarian regimes, view the crackdowns as proof of America’s hypocrisy on human rights and freedom of speech. Still others see them as the latest sordid chapter of America’s ongoing culture wars.In some ways, the protests and the response to them are a Rorschach test for the world — the analysis often offering more insight into local politics than into America.Here is a selection of views from around the world.France: Warnings of ‘Wokisme’Many in France, including Prime Minister Gabriel Attal, see the pro-Palestinian protests as another example of the dangers of “woke” culture — “le wokisme” — which they worry is being imported from the United States and threatening core French Republican values.On Friday, police officers charged into an elite university in Paris, Sciences Po, to remove students who had occupied the building overnight.

68,Israeli Officials Weigh Sharing Power With Arab States in Postwar Gaza,"For months, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel has avoided detailed public discussion about Gaza’s postwar future. Trying to placate both his far-right allies, who seek to rebuild Israeli settlements in Gaza, and Israel’s foreign partners, who want Gaza returned to Palestinian governance, Mr. Netanyahu has stopped short of any specific declaration.Behind the scenes, however, senior officials in his office have been weighing an expansive plan for postwar Gaza, in which Israel would offer to share oversight of the territory with an alliance of Arab countries, including Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, as well as the United States, according to three Israeli officials and five people who have discussed the plan with members of the Israeli government.According to that proposal, Israel would do so in exchange for normalized relations between itself and Saudi Arabia, according to the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity given the sensitivity of the matter.Far-right members of Mr. Netanyahu’s coalition are almost certain to dismiss such an idea, and so are the Arab countries mentioned as possible participants. But it is the clearest sign yet that officials at the highest levels of Israel’s government are thinking about Gaza’s postwar future, despite saying little in public, and could be a starting point in future negotiations.The disclosure comes against the backdrop of intense international efforts to get Israel and Hamas to agree to a cease-fire that could eventually become a permanent truce, and it follows growing pressure on Israel to plan for what comes next. Israel’s reluctance to determine how to govern Gaza has created a power vacuum in much of the territory, leading to lawlessness and worsening the dire humanitarian situation.Arab officials and analysts have called the power-sharing plan unworkable because it does not create an explicit path toward a Palestinian state, which the Emirati and Saudi governments have said is a prerequisite for their involvement in postwar planning. But others have cautiously welcomed the proposal because it at least suggests greater flexibility among Israeli leaders than their public statements suggest.",By Patrick Kingsley,2024-05-03 05:03:48-04:00,world,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/03/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-postwar-plan.html,The New York Times

But the attack, which was captured on video, sent a chilling message through police ranks and to residents of the country’s embattled capital, Port-au-Prince.“It symbolized that no one was safe,” said Reginald Delva, a Haitian security consultant and former Haitian government minister.The torching of the police chief’s house deepened fears among Haitians that their country was on the brink of collapse in the face of an onslaught by a coalition of armed gangs that had seized control of many parts of Port-au-Prince and were threatening key institutions, like the National Palace.But today, Haiti’s outgunned and outnumbered police have managed — at least for now — to hold their own against the gangs in some fights and defend the few remaining government buildings under state control.As a result, the police have gone from a much-maligned force, considered by many analysts to be inept and corrupt, to acquiring a newfound respect among some Haitians.",By David C.

71,Voters Swing to Labour in English Local Elections: Key Takeaways,"While the votes in local elections in England and Wales were still being counted on Friday, a picture has begun to emerge of significant losses for the governing Conservative Party.The voting on Thursday to elect councilors, mayors and police commissioners in local elections, seen as a last test of public opinion before a general election expected later this year, portends a difficult road ahead for the party.Here are four takeaways.The Conservatives could be in serious trouble.Leading up to the local elections, the question was not whether the Conservatives would suffer, but just how bad the blow might be. The party has trailed Labour, the main opposition party, in opinion polls for some time, after a series of scandals, the implosion of Boris Johnson’s administration and the embarrassment of the 45-day prime ministership of Liz Truss, leading many Britons to look elsewhere for leadership.By midday on Friday, the early results suggested that the party might have fared even more poorly than its leaders had feared. When all is said and done, some analysts think the Conservatives could lose as many as 500 council seats, a signal of serious trouble ahead for Prime Minister Rishi Sunak’s beleaguered Conservative Party.ImageBritain’s beleaguered prime minister, Rishi Sunak, faces a daunting challenge in the general election expected later this year.Credit...Molly Darlington/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesAround one-third of England’s council seats were contested, along with 11 mayoral seats in major English metro areas.

72,U.S. Approved More Weapons for Ukraine. Now It’s a Race Against Time.,"Last Sunday, as Russia put pressure on Ukrainian forces across a 600-mile front line, Ukraine received a shipment of anti-armor rockets, missiles and badly needed 155-millimeter artillery shells. It was the first installment from the $61 billion in military aid that President Biden approved just four days earlier.A second batch of those weapons and ammunition arrived on Monday. And a fresh supply of Patriot interceptor missiles from Spain arrived in Poland on Tuesday. They would be at the Ukrainian front soon, a senior Spanish official said.The push is on to move weapons to a depleted Ukrainian army that is back on its heels and desperate for aid. Over the last week, a flurry of planes, trains and trucks have arrived at NATO depots in Europe carrying ammunition and smaller weapon systems to be shipped across Ukraine’s borders.“Now we need to move fast, and we are,” Mr. Biden said on April 24 when he signed the bill approving the aid. He added, “I’m making sure the shipments start right away.”But it may prove difficult for Mr. Biden and other NATO allies to maintain the urgency. Weapons pledged by the United States, Britain and Germany — all of which have announced major new military support over the last three weeks — could take months to arrive in numbers substantial enough to bolster Ukraine’s defenses on the battlefield, officials said.That has raised questions about Ukraine’s ability to hold off the Russian attacks that have had Kyiv at a disadvantage for several months.","By Lara Jakes, Eric Schmitt, Marc Santora and Julian E.

75,Moving Target,"Back in the years 2020 and 2021, years that are increasingly easy to categorize as “the past” rather than the ongoing present, I worked from home every day, and on most of those days I exercised from home, too. In the late morning between meetings, or around lunchtime, I rode a stationary bike or lifted weights or danced to Rihanna with a choreographer who broadcast a daily live class from an enviable house in Joshua Tree.It was easy, in those days when nothing much else was easy, to find time to exercise. The routine that had evaded me most of my life was, during those years, achievable. In the years since, this routine has become unrealistic most of the time. Days are once again organized around the office and its commute. The options for how to spend nonwork time are no longer confined to a limited lockdown menu of what can be accomplished at a distance of six feet or more. Exercise has, once again, become something that I put on a to-do list and try to squeeze in before or after work, an essential practice, but one that now competes with the entire open world for my time and attention.I’ve settled where many of us do, on a non-routine whereby I exercise whenever I can: a before-work jog when I can rouse myself, quick rounds of strength training between meetings on days I work remotely, longer workouts on weekends. I constantly feel that I’m not doing enough, not engaged in a rigorous enough program of optimization.I read this week about a recent study in which people who exercised in the evening saw their risk of death decline by as much as 28 percent compared with those who exercised in the morning or afternoon. This, I thought, was compelling! I should become an after-work exerciser, one of those people who changes into their gym clothes before leaving the office, who runs on a treadmill while watching “The Bachelor,” and — who knows what else might be possible? — eats three ounces of lean protein for dinner at 8, spends a good 20 minutes melting the ravages of sitting from my hips with a foam roller and is in bed with a book — no screens! — by 10.I quickly realized this was a ridiculous fantasy. I’m a dutiful exerciser, a doing-it-because-I-have-to person, always under slight duress, wanting to have it done so that I can feel accomplished but also always fighting my essential nature, which is, I’ve grown OK with admitting, a little lazy. My exercise regimen is not a movable feast that I can shift into an optimal time slot. I jumped to the part in The Times’s story on the study that I always look for in stories of this ilk, the one that assures me that while the study is convincing, the most important thing about exercise for most people is that they do it. There it was, courtesy of Angelo Sabag, an exercise physiologist who led the study: “Whenever you can exercise,” Dr. Sabag said. “That is the answer.”Here is where I’d like to stop, having determined that any exercise is better than none, and pat myself on the back for doing enough. And I will, for today, because it’s Saturday and I have the luxury of midday exercising and I’m not going to waste it. But I’m trying these days to approach things about myself that seem fixed with more curiosity. So while I jog around the park in the springtime sun, I’m committed to mulling some questions. What is it about the way I approach exercise that fills me with a bit of dread, that makes it a chore rather than a joy or a privilege or at least something I approach with interest? If I wanted to exercise in the evenings, for potential health benefits or just because it might be nice to switch things up, how can I do that in a way that doesn’t feel like punishment?",By Melissa Kirsch,2024-05-04 06:21:07-04:00,briefing,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/04/briefing/moving-target.html,The New York Times

But in Mexico, the government has repeatedly denied that fentanyl abuse is spilling over its border and has asserted that the problem is exclusive to its northern neighbors.Weak detection efforts, in public health settings or during drug death investigations, have meant that the extent of fentanyl’s reach in Mexico is largely an open question.“We don’t know, because we’re not looking for it,” said Xóchitl Cárdenas, a forensic services chemist at the attorney general’s office in Sonora State, along Mexico’s northern border, where experts say the fentanyl crisis is acute.Ms. Cárdenas was one of about a dozen Mexican forensic scientists, medical researchers and government workers who traveled to Vancouver and Victoria this week to learn how Canadian agencies are responding to the toxic drug supply.

77,Was the Stone Age Actually the Wood Age?,"In 1836, Christian Jürgensen Thomsen, a Danish antiquarian, brought the first semblance of order to prehistory, suggesting that the early hominids of Europe had gone through three stages of technological development that were reflected in the production of tools. The basic chronology — Stone Age to Bronze Age to Iron Age — now underpins the archaeology of most of the Old World (and cartoons like “The Flintstones” and “The Croods”).Thomsen could well have substituted Wood Age for Stone Age, according to Thomas Terberger, an archaeologist and head of research at the Department of Cultural Heritage of Lower Saxony, in Germany.“We can probably assume that wooden tools have been around just as long as stone ones, that is, two and a half or three million years,“ he said. “But since wood deteriorates and rarely survives, preservation bias distorts our view of antiquity.” Primitive stone implements have traditionally characterized the Lower Paleolithic period, which lasted from about 2.7 million years ago to 200,000 years ago. Of the thousands of archaeological sites that can be traced to the era, wood has been recovered from fewer than 10.Dr. Terberger was team leader of a study published last month in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences that provided the first comprehensive report on the wooden objects excavated from 1994 to 2008 in the peat of an open-pit coal mine near Schöningen, in northern Germany. The rich haul included two dozen complete or fragmented spears (each about as tall as an N.B.A. center) and double-pointed throwing sticks (half the length of a pool cue) but no hominid bones. The objects date from the end of a warm interglacial period 300,000 years ago, about when early Neanderthals were supplanting Homo heidelbergensis, their immediate predecessors in Europe. The projectiles unearthed at the Schöningen site, known as Spear Horizon, are considered the oldest preserved hunting weapons.In the mid-1990s, the discovery of three of the spears — along with stone tools and the butchered remains of 10 wild horses — upended prevailing ideas about the intelligence, social interaction and toolmaking skills of our extinct human ancestors. At the time, the scientific consensus was that humans were simple scavengers who lived hand-to-mouth until about 40,000 years ago.“It turned out that these pre-Homo sapiens had fashioned tools and weapons to hunt big game,” Dr. Terberger said. “Not only did they communicate together to topple prey, but they were sophisticated enough to organize the butchering and roasting.”",By Franz Lidz,2024-05-04 03:00:45-04:00,science,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/04/science/archaeology-neanderthals-wood.html,The New York Times
78,Henry Cuellar Indicted Over Bribery Scheme,"Representative Henry Cuellar, a Texas Democrat in a crucial swing district, and his wife were charged with participating in a yearslong $600,000 bribery scheme involving Azerbaijan and a Mexican bank, according to a federal indictment unsealed in Houston on Friday.The accusations against Mr. Cuellar, 68, and his wife Imelda, 67, center on allegations of bribery and money laundering in connection with their efforts on behalf of an oil and gas company owned by Azerbaijan’s leaders as well as an unnamed bank based in Mexico City, according to the 54-page complaint.Mr. Cuellar, a Laredo native first elected in 2004, is also accused of acting as an agent of a foreign entity while a U.S. government official — by delivering a speech favoring Azerbaijan in Congress and inserting provisions into aid bills to benefit those who were paying bribes to his family.The government claimed that Mr. Cuellar, who once served as Texas secretary of state, was paid to back legislation intended to stymie regulation of the payday loan industry, which has been accused of predatory lending practices against the poor. He also tried to weaken money laundering laws that affected Mexico’s banking sector, according to prosecutors.Mr. Cuellar “agreed to influence legislative activity and to advise and pressure high-ranking U.S. executive branch officials regarding measures beneficial to the bank,” they said.Many of Mr. Cuellar’s actions, taken at face value, appeared to be legitimate policymaking activities, albeit favoring foreign-owned businesses. But the indictment claimed hidden motives, and prosecutors compiled tables of secret payments that cast those actions as an illegal and mercenary scheme.",By Glenn Thrush and Luke Broadwater,2024-05-03 14:31:59-04:00,us,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/03/us/politics/henry-cuellar-indictment.html,The New York Times
79,"A Gaza Doctor Has Died in Israeli Custody, Palestinian Groups Say","A Palestinian doctor from the Gaza Strip, detained by Israeli forces and held for four months, has died in detention, Palestinian officials and detainee rights groups say.Dr. Adnan Ahmad Albursh, 50, the head of orthopedics at Al-Shifa Hospital, the Gaza Strip’s biggest medical center, was detained along with other doctors in December by Israeli forces when they raided a hospital, according to the Palestinian Commission of Detainees’ Affairs and the Palestinian Prisoners Club, which advocate for the rights of Palestinian detainees held by Israel.Israel’s military and prison service did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The Times of Israel cited the military as confirming that the Israeli prison service had declared Dr. Albursh dead on April 19, without giving a cause of death. It said he had been detained for national security reasons.Israel has detained thousands of Palestinians from Gaza, including women and children. Former detainees have said that they suffered beatings and other physical abuse in Israeli custody, and the United Nations human rights office has said Israel’s treatment of detainees might amount to torture, which Israel denies. International human rights groups say they have been denied access to detainees.Dozens of Palestinians have died in Israeli custody since Oct. 7, according to the Israeli military and rights groups. The Israeli military has said it is aware of the deaths of 27 Palestinians in its custody.The prisoner rights groups accused Israel of abusing and killing Dr. Albursh, but did not offer evidence for their claims, or say how they knew about the circumstances of his confinement and death.",By Raja Abdulrahim,2024-05-03 14:07:52-04:00,world,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/03/world/middleeast/doctor-died-israeli-detention.html,The New York Times
80,"Gas Stove Pollution Risk Is Greatest in Smaller Homes, Study Finds","For decades, scientists have worked to clean up air pollution from factories, cars and power plants. But researchers are increasingly turning their attention to the air that people breathe indoors. And one appliance has come to the fore as a source of pollutants harmful to human health: the humble gas stove.A new study from researchers at Stanford University sheds light on how much Americans may be exposed, indoors, to nitrogen dioxide, which comes from burning coal and gas and has been linked to asthma and other respiratory conditions.The researchers found that, across the country, short-term nitrogen dioxide exposure from typical gas stove use frequently exceeded benchmarks set by both the World Health Organization and the United States Environmental Protection Agency. In the longer term, using gas or propane stoves meant that the typical American could breathe in three-quarters of the nitrogen dioxide levels deemed safe by the W.H.O. within their own homes.As with outdoor pollution, disadvantaged households may be more exposed, the researchers found. Because gas more easily spreads throughout smaller spaces, people in homes smaller than 800 square feet were exposed to four times more nitrogen dioxide in the long term than people in homes larger than 3,000 square feet, the study found. Black and Latino households were exposed to 20 percent more nitrogen dioxide compared with the national average.“We’ve done a really good job in this country of reducing outdoor pollution,” said Rob Jackson, professor of earth system science at the Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability and a principal investigator on the study, which was published on Friday in Science Advances. “But we’ve ignored the risks that people face indoors. And that’s the air that we’re breathing most of the time.”And though home cooks who use a gas stove are particularly exposed to nitrogen dioxide, he said, “we’re getting a better handle on the migration of pollution down the hall, to the living room and the bedroom.”",By Hiroko Tabuchi,2024-05-03 14:00:06-04:00,climate,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/03/climate/gas-stove-indoor-pollution.html,The New York Times
81,"Liberia Moves to Create War Crimes Court, Decades After Civil Wars Ended","Liberia’s president has signed an executive order establishing a war crimes court, the culmination of a decades-long effort to bring justice to victims of the country’s two civil wars, which killed an estimated 250,000 people from 1989 to 2003.Lawmakers in Parliament — including some who are expected to face prosecution under the court — had passed a resolution calling for the move last month.“For peace and harmony to have a chance to prevail, justice and healing must perfect the groundwork,” President Joseph Boakai said as he signed the order on Thursday, to the applause of lawmakers and ministers.Although some of those behind the violence have faced prosecution abroad, no one has been held legally accountable within the country for the massacres, rape, torture and conscription of child soldiers that left deep scars on generations of people in Liberia, a West African nation founded 200 years ago by freed slaves from the United States.It was unclear on Friday how many cases might come before the court and when they might begin. Many of the perpetrators, and their victims, have since died.Mr. Boakai’s executive order also paved the way for an economics crimes court, which would cover the companies and individuals who funded the wars’ various factions, but Parliament will first have to pass legislation to establish it.",By Dounard Bondo and Ruth Maclean,2024-05-03 12:17:01-04:00,world,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/03/world/africa/liberia-court-war-crimes.html,The New York Times
82,"Dortmund, Bayern Munich and the Siren Song of Yesterday","In those few minutes after Niclas Füllkrug had scored, as the Yellow Wall swayed and roared, Borussia Dortmund must have felt the stirring of some distant memory. Waves of attacks pounded down on Paris St.-Germain, now dizzied and wearied. The world shimmered with possibility. A place in the Champions League final felt, for a moment, close enough to touch.This is how it used to be, or at least some approximation of it, back in the days when Dortmund made Europe shake. Gregor Kobel, the team’s goalkeeper, was pulling off daring turns in his own penalty area. Mats Hummels, a fixture in the lineup a decade ago, was spraying languid passes with the outside of his foot. Jadon Sancho and Karim Adeyemi were electric, relentless.There is a chance, of course, that it will all count for nothing. More than a chance, really: Dortmund may live to regret that a second goal never came. P.S.G. had enough opportunities to hint at its threat, too, hitting the post twice in the space of 10 seconds at one point. It may not prove quite so forgiving in the return leg in Paris on Tuesday.But that Dortmund will travel to France with hope — perhaps even with a little expectation — is still an unanticipated development. This was supposed, after all, to be a chastening week for German soccer: Most expected Dortmund and Bayern Munich, the Bundesliga’s two great crisis clubs, to be exposed in the Champions League semifinals. And yet, halfway through, both teams remain vividly alive.ImageNiclas Füllkrug scored the goal that gave Dortmund a 1-0 victory over P.S.G. in their two-legged Champions League semifinal.Credit...Ina Fassbender/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesDortmund’s case was the more extreme.

83,The Death of a Treaty Could Be a Lifesaver for Taiwan,"During a military exercise with the Philippines that began last month, the U.S. Army deployed a new type of covert weapon that is designed to be hidden in plain sight.Called Typhon, it consists of a modified 40-foot shipping container that conceals up to four missiles that rotate upward to fire. It can be loaded with weapons including the Tomahawk — a cruise missile that can hit targets on land and ships at sea more than 1,150 miles away.The weapon, and other small mobile launchers like it, would have been illegal just five years ago under the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, which prohibited U.S. and Russian forces from having land-based cruise or ballistic missiles with ranges between about 300 miles and 3,400 miles.In 2019, President Donald J. Trump abandoned the treaty, in part because the United States believed Russia had violated the terms of the pact for years. But U.S. officials said that China, with its growing long-range missile arsenal, was also a reason the Trump administration decided to withdraw.The decision freed the Pentagon to build the weapons that are now poised to defend Taiwan from a Chinese invasion. It also coincided with a rethinking of modern war by U.S. Marine Corps leaders. They recommended retiring certain heavyweight and cumbersome weapons like 155-millimeter howitzers and tanks — which they thought would be of little use against Chinese forces in the Pacific — and replacing them with lighter and more flexible arms like truck-mounted anti-ship missiles.At the time, the Pentagon had no land-based anti-ship weapons. Other militaries, however, already did. Then in April 2022, Ukrainian ground troops used a similar weapon, Neptune anti-ship cruise missiles launched from trucks, to sink the Russian cruiser Moskva in the Black Sea.A New Pacific Arsenal to Counter ChinaWith missiles, submarines and alliances, the Biden administration has built a presence in the region to rein in Beijing’s expansionist goals.",By John Ismay,2024-05-03 10:07:10-04:00,us,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/03/us/politics/china-taiwan-inf-treaty.html,The New York Times
84,Pro-Palestinian Encampments Spread to Campuses in Other Countries,"Pro-Palestinian students at one of France’s most elite universities, Sciences Po, occupied a campus building overnight. Like-minded demonstrators at University College London set up an encampment. And tents with Palestinian flags stretched out this week across university campuses in Australia.The tensions gripping universities in the United States appear to be spreading to other countries, where student activists have challenged their own schools’ stances on the war in Gaza and ties to Israel.Demonstrators at several universities in France have put pressure on administrators to more forcefully condemn Israel’s military offense in Gaza and review partnerships with Israeli universities and private donors.Police officers went into Sciences Po on Friday morning to clear out a group of pro-Palestinian protesters who had occupied a campus building overnight and refused to leave until their demands were met, according to a statement from the university. The intervention came after a town hall debate about the Gaza war on Thursday at the university — which counts top politicians, civil servants and business leaders among its alumni — failed to defuse tensions.The university said that students had breached an agreement not to disrupt classes and exams, and that it had made the “difficult decision” to involve the police after multiple attempts at dialogue failed. Several buildings were closed on Friday as a “security measure,” and a few dozen students were removed without violence, the statement said. According to live video shared on Instagram, students sitting in a hall chanted, “We ask for justice! We get the police!” as officers pulled them out.

85,Iran Says It Released Crew of Israel-Linked Ship It Detained,"Iran has released the crew of a container ship with links to Israel that it had detained last month, but is continuing to hold the vessel, the country’s foreign minister has said, according to Iranian media.Iranian forces seized the Portuguese-flagged ship, the MSC Aries, as tensions between Iran and Israel were rising. Israel and the United States have condemned the seizure, with the U.S. National Security Council calling on Iran to release the vessel and its crew immediately.The Iranian foreign minister, Hossein Amir Abdollahian, said that the crew had been released “with a humane approach” and that “it is possible for them to return” to their home countries, Tasnim News, a semiofficial news agency affiliated with the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, reported on Thursday.The ship itself is still “under judicial detention,” the agency quoted him as saying. Israel and the United States did not immediately comment.The MSC Aries, a 1,200-foot cargo vessel, had 25 crew members on board, according to its operator. It is operated by MSC, a major shipping company, but belongs to an affiliate of Zodiac Maritime, which is part of the Zodiac Group, owned by the Israel-born billionaire Eyal Ofer.At the time it was detained on April 13, MSC said the vessel had been boarded by “Iranian authorities” via helicopter as it passed the Strait of Hormuz. A video published by Iranian state news media showed a military helicopter hovering above what appeared to be the stern of the ship, with at least two soldiers descending by rope onto the deck.The soldiers were part of the Revolutionary Guards, according to IRNA, the Iranian state news agency.It was not the first time Iran had seized a commercial vessel. In January, Iran’s navy seized a tanker loaded with oil off the coast of Oman. In that seizure, soldiers also descended from a helicopter. Before the war in Gaza, the United States said that Iran had “harassed, attacked or interfered” with more than a dozen internationally flagged merchant ships in recent years.Christopher F.

86,What Happens When NASA Loses Eyes on Earth? We’re About to Find Out.,"Sometime in the next few years — no one knows exactly when — three NASA satellites, each one as heavy as an elephant, will go dark.Already they are drifting, losing height bit by bit. They have been gazing down at the planet for over two decades, far longer than anyone expected, helping us forecast the weather, manage wildfires, monitor oil spills and more. But age is catching up to them, and soon they will send their last transmissions and begin their slow, final fall to Earth.It’s a moment scientists are dreading.When the three orbiters — Terra, Aqua and Aura — are powered down, much of the data they’ve been collecting will end with them, and newer satellites won’t pick up all of the slack. Researchers will either have to rely on alternate sources that might not meet their exact needs or seek workarounds to allow their records to continue.With some of the data these satellites gather, the situation is even worse: No other instruments will keep collecting it. In a few short years, the fine features they reveal about our world will become much fuzzier.“Losing this irreplaceable data is simply tragic,” said Susan Solomon, an atmospheric chemist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. “Just when the planet most needs for us to focus on understanding how we are affected by it, and how we are affecting it, we seem to be disastrously asleep at the wheel.”The main area we’re losing eyes on is the stratosphere, the all-important home of the ozone layer.Preparing Aqua for launch at Vandenberg Air Force Base, Calif., in 2002; Aura launching from Vandenberg Air Force Base in 2004; the Terra spacecraft in a clean room at Vandenberg Air Force Base in 1999.Credit...KSC/NASA; Thom Baur/Boeing; KSC/NASA",By Raymond Zhong,2024-05-03 05:05:01-04:00,climate,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/03/climate/nasa-satellites-data.html,The New York Times
87,"Noisy, Gaudy and Spiritual: Young Pilgrims Embrace an Ancient Goddess","In a din of firecrackers, cymbals and horns, a team of devotees carried the shrouded wooden statue of a serene-faced woman, holding her aloft on a brightly decorated litter as they navigated through tens of thousands of onlookers.As the carriers nudged forward, hundreds of people were lined up ahead of them, kneeling on the road and waiting for the moment when the statue would pass over their heads.Some wept after it did; many smiled and snapped selfies. “I love Mazu, and Mazu loves me,” the crowd shouted.Mazu, sometimes known as the Goddess of the Sea, is the most widely venerated of dozens of folk deities that many people in Taiwan turn to for solace, guidance and good fortune. The huge annual processions to honor her are noisy and gaudy. And yet for many, they are also deeply spiritual events, acts of faith showing that Mazu and other spirits remain vibrant presences here, alongside Buddhism and Christianity.ImageFollowers of Mazu bowed and lit incense before a statue of Mazu at a temple.ImageCarrying Mazu through a crowd of people.

88,Thousands Believe Covid Vaccines Harmed Them. Is Anyone Listening?,"Within minutes of getting the Johnson & Johnson Covid-19 vaccine, Michelle Zimmerman felt pain racing from her left arm up to her ear and down to her fingertips. Within days, she was unbearably sensitive to light and struggled to remember simple facts.She was 37, with a Ph.D. in neuroscience, and until then could ride her bicycle 20 miles, teach a dance class and give a lecture on artificial intelligence, all in the same day. Now, more than three years later, she lives with her parents. Eventually diagnosed with brain damage, she cannot work, drive or even stand for long periods of time.“When I let myself think about the devastation of what this has done to my life, and how much I’ve lost, sometimes it feels even too hard to comprehend,” said Dr. Zimmerman, who believes her injury is due to a contaminated vaccine batch.The Covid vaccines, a triumph of science and public health, are estimated to have prevented millions of hospitalizations and deaths. Yet even the best vaccines produce rare but serious side effects. And the Covid vaccines have been given to more than 270 million people in the United States, in nearly 677 million doses.Dr. Zimmerman’s account is among the more harrowing, but thousands of Americans believe they suffered serious side effects following Covid vaccination. As of April, just over 13,000 vaccine-injury compensation claims have been filed with the federal government — but to little avail. Only 19 percent have been reviewed. Only 47 of those were deemed eligible for compensation, and only 12 have been paid out, at an average of about $3,600.Some scientists fear that patients with real injuries are being denied help and believe that more needs to be done to clarify the possible risks.",By Apoorva Mandavilli,2024-05-03 05:00:28-04:00,health,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/03/health/covid-vaccines-side-effects.html,The New York Times

But it’s not just an English story.The Premier League is the world’s most global league, with a reach that carries its games, its teams and its stars to almost every country.That means a sizable portion of the world’s population is deeply invested in its best title race in a decade.And for lifelong fans in far-flung places, every moment matters.A Race the Whole World Is WatchingBy Muktita Suhartono, Elian Peltier, Shawna Richer and Rory SmithElian Peltier tracked Arsenal in West Africa, Muktita Suhartono watched Liverpool in Bangkok and Shawna Richer was with Manchester City fans in Toronto.The teams might bear the names of English towns, the stadiums might sit on English soil and the stands might still be primarily filled with English fans, but the Premier League slipped its borders long ago. The world’s most popular sports league has, for some time, been a global soccer competition that just happens to be staged in England.This season has crystallized that perfectly.For the first time in a decade, three teams — Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester City — remained in contention to win the championship as the season entered its final weeks. The fates of those teams have not simply had an impact on anxious, ardent fans in London, Liverpool or Manchester. Their results have been followed just as avidly in North America, Africa, Asia and countless other places, where fans rise early, stay up late and seek out any screen they can to follow their teams.Last weekend, with the three contenders playing across two days, The New York Times asked reporters and photographers to track fans watching in Bangkok; Lagos, Nigeria; and Toronto.

90,U.K. Conservatives Suffer Sharp Setbacks in Local Elections,"Britain’s Conservative Party suffered sweeping setbacks on Friday in local elections that are viewed as a barometer for how the party will perform in a coming general election and a key test for the embattled prime minister, Rishi Sunak.With most of the results announced by Friday evening, the Conservatives were on course for one of their worst performances in a set of local elections since the 1990s. The party has lost more than 400 seats so far, including six in Hartlepool, a town in northeast England emblematic of the expanded political territory it had claimed since Brexit, and is now losing to a resurgent Labour Party.The Conservatives did score one notable victory in a closely watched race for mayor of Tees Valley, also in northeast England, where the Tory incumbent, Ben Houchen, held on, eking out a reduced majority.Almost everywhere else, however, the picture was bleak for the Conservatives, who have trailed the opposition Labour Party by double digits in national polls for 18 months and face the prospect of a landslide defeat in a general election.“It appears to be the worst local elections for the Conservatives since the final years of the era of Margaret Thatcher and John Major,” said Robert Hayward, a polling expert and Conservative member of the House of Lords, referring to the period before Tony Blair’s emphatic general election victory in 1997.In Blackpool South, a seaside district, Labour won a special election for a parliamentary seat in a huge swing of votes away from the Conservatives, who placed a distant second, narrowly in front of Reform U.K., a small right-wing party.

91,‘Dead Poets Society’ Has Some Distinctly Australian Relevance,"The Australia Letter is a weekly newsletter from our Australia bureau. This week’s issue is written by Damien Cave, the Australia bureau chief since 2017.With my 13-year-old daughter home for a break from her one-year adventure at a boarding school in the Australian bush, we put on an old movie the other night that she had asked to see: “Dead Poets Society.”As many of you probably know, it’s a coming-of-age story set at an American private school, starring an inspiring teacher played by Robin Williams. I loved it when it came out in 1989 (I was a young teen then myself), but when the director’s name — Peter Weir — appeared onscreen in my Sydney living room, I did a double take.I’d never realized that the movie, a beloved classic for many Americans, was directed by an Australian. Somehow, the same bloke responsible for Australian classics like “Gallipoli” and “Picnic at Hanging Rock” was also the director of very American favorites like “Dead Poets Society” and “The Truman Show.”Like me, or so I would like to believe, Mr. Weir seemed to be conversant in the cultures of these two English-speaking settler nations, able, perhaps, to see more clearly the deep grooves and dark shadows of each because he’d had the chance to look from a distant perspective.I watched the movie with fresh eyes. I was already looking for what secrets and lessons it might hold for my daughter. I wondered if I would feel more sympathetic to the adults rather than the moderately rebellious teens this time (nope), but I also decided to look for what might make the movie more Australian than I had noticed in earlier viewings.What, if anything, would Australian audiences have found relevant and relatable?At first, the movie struck me as extremely American. I recognized the emphasis on Henry David Thoreau, an American writer who lived not far from where I had grown up in Massachusetts. His quotes from “Walden” about the need to live deliberately and “suck out all the marrow of life” were already in our family mix: I’d sent a bit of Thoreau to my daughter in letters, an analog exchange that I recently wrote about in an essay for The Times.",By Damien Cave,2024-05-03 02:32:56-04:00,world,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/03/world/australia/dead-poets-society.html,The New York Times

The current deal would include a weekslong truce and the release of hostages held by Hamas and of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. The proposal would also allow civilians to return to northern Gaza and would enable increased delivery of aid to the territory.The complex cease-fire negotiations have dragged on for months. This week, Israel softened some of its positions, saying that it would allow Palestinians to return north en masse and would lower the number of hostages accepted for the cease-fire to 33, from 40.But Israel’s insistence on a ground invasion of Rafah, a city where around a million Palestinians are sheltering in the southern Gaza Strip, remains a major sticking point. “If the enemy carries out the Rafah operation, negotiations will stop,” a Hamas spokesman said.Latest updates:Turkey: The country said that it has halted all trade with Israel until uninterrupted humanitarian aid is allowed into Gaza.Reconstruction: A U.N. report said that rebuilding all of the homes destroyed by Israel’s military offensive in Gaza could take 80 years.ImageUkrainian soldiers during a simulated chemical attack, in the Donetsk region last year.Credit...Nicole Tung for The New York Times",By Daniel E.

93,A U.N. report says rebuilding all the homes destroyed in Gaza could take 80 years.,"Rebuilding all the homes destroyed by Israel’s military offensive in the Gaza Strip could take until the next century if the pace of reconstruction were to match what it was after wars there in 2014 and 2021, according to a United Nations report released on Thursday.Citing data from the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics, the U.N. report said that as of April 15, some 370,000 homes in Gaza had been damaged, 79,000 of which have been destroyed. If those destroyed homes were rebuilt at the same pace as they were after the two previous wars — an average of 992 per year — it would take 80 years, according to projections in the report from the United Nations Development Program and the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia.The report detailed the war’s socioeconomic impact on the Palestinian population and said “the level of destruction in Gaza is such that the required assistance to rebuild would be on a scale not seen since 1948” to replace public infrastructure, including schools and hospitals.The report said that even if Israel were to allow five times as much construction material into Gaza after this war as it did after the war in 2021 — “the most optimistic scenario” — rebuilding all of the destroyed homes would still take until 2040. That projection does not account for the time it would take to repair the hundreds of thousands of homes that were damaged but not destroyed.The cost of rebuilding Gaza is increasing “exponentially” each day the fighting continues, Abdallah Al Dardari, the director of the U.N.D.P.’s regional bureau for Arab states, speaking over a video call from Amman, Jordan, said at a news conference on Thursday.Mr. Al Dardari said that before “some sort of normalcy” can be established for Palestinians in Gaza, an estimated 37 million tons of debris must be cleared to allow for the construction of temporary shelters and, eventually, the rebuilding of homes.The report also found that the unemployment rate for Palestinians across the occupied West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza surged to roughly 46 percent from about 26 percent after six months of war.Over those six months, poverty rates in the Palestinian territories more than doubled, to an estimated 57.2 percent from 26.7 percent. That means 1.67 million Palestinians were pushed into poverty after the war began, the report said. Its estimates were based on a poverty line of $6.85 a day.The effects of the war on Palestinians both in and out of Gaza “will be felt for years,” the report said.Anushka Patil is a reporter covering live news.

94,Friday Briefing: Hamas Considers Israel’s Proposal,"ImageKhan Younis, in southern Gaza.Credit...Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesHamas examined Israel’s proposal and hinted at progressThe leader of Hamas’s political wing said that the group was studying Israel’s latest proposal for a deal with a “positive spirit,” and that the group would soon attend a new round of talks in Cairo. His statement raised hope for the stalled effort.The proposal, which the U.S. has pushed in recent days, would include a weekslong temporary truce — its exact duration is unclear — as well as the release of hostages held by Hamas and Palestinian prisoners in Israel. It would also allow civilians to return to northern Gaza, and enable increased delivery of aid to the territory.In Israel, the war cabinet met to discuss the cease-fire negotiations and a planned invasion of Rafah, where around a million people have been sheltering, according to an Israeli official. The anticipated offensive, which the U.S. has repeatedly urged Israel to abandon, has been a seemingly intractable sticking point in the cease-fire talks. If it goes forward, Hamas has promised to end negotiations immediately.U.S. campuses: President Biden condemned the violence unfolding at universities across the country. He said Americans have “the right to protest, but not a right to cause chaos.” He rejected the notion of sending in the National Guard, which some Republicans have suggested.ImageUkrainian soldiers wore gas masks during a training exercise that simulated a chemical attack.Credit...Nicole Tung for The New York Times",By Amelia Nierenberg,2024-05-02 17:10:05-04:00,world,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/02/world/asia/hamas-israel-proposal-russia-asia.html,The New York Times
95,"Hamas Studies a Gaza Cease-Fire Offer From Israel, and Hints at Progress","A Hamas leader said Thursday that the group would soon send a delegation to Cairo to “complete ongoing discussions” on a cease-fire deal for the war in the Gaza Strip, raising hopes of progress in the stalled efforts for a truce.The latest cease-fire proposal, which has been forcefully pushed by the Biden administration in recent days, comes after nearly seven devastating months of war. The deal would include a weekslong temporary truce — the exact duration is unclear — and the release of hostages held by Hamas and Palestinian prisoners in Israel. It would also allow the return of civilians to the largely depopulated northern part of Gaza, and enable increased delivery of aid to the territory.Ismail Haniyeh, the leader of Hamas’s political wing, said the group was studying the latest proposal from Israel, which includes some Israeli concessions, with a “positive spirit.” A Hamas delegation will go to Egypt soon to seek a deal that “realizes our people’s demands and ends the aggression,” according to a statement by the group.ImageKhan Younis, in the southern Gaza Strip, on Thursday.Credit...Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesLess than a day earlier, a Hamas spokesman, Osama Hamdan, said on Lebanese television, “Our position on the current negotiating paper is negative.” But the Hamas press office later said the group had not yet stated an official position, and that Mr. Hamdan’s comment was not an outright rejection of the proposal.In Israel, the war cabinet met Thursday evening to discuss the negotiations as well as a planned Israeli invasion of Rafah, the southernmost city in Gaza, where around a million people have been sheltering, according to an Israeli official who was not authorized to communicate with the media and requested anonymity.","By Adam Rasgon, Hwaida Saad and Thomas Fuller",2024-05-02 17:04:31-04:00,world,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/02/world/middleeast/hamas-israel-gaza-ceasefire.html,The New York Times
96,"At Just 5-Foot-6, a College Student Is Living an Improbable Football Dream","COLLEGE STATION, Texas — Sam Salz emerged from Texas A&M’s Bright Football Complex at dusk in early February, eager to explain how he got here.“Over there,” he pointed, patting down his yarmulke with his other hand. “That’s where it happened.”The patch of land in the distance sat adjacent to where the Aggies football team practiced. Salz, just a student with a dream in the spring of 2021, would arrive at the field every day an hour before Texas A&M practiced and stay an hour after the practice concluded.AdvertisementA 5-foot-6, 160-pound Orthodox Jewish student who had never played organized football, Salz intended to try out for the SEC program as a walk-on. He worked on getting into shape and getting faster, even if he didn’t know how. He used old shoes instead of cones for drills. He lined up trash cans to simulate the line of scrimmage. He had no cleats. He didn’t even have a position to practice. He just worked.A graduate of Kohelet Yeshiva High School — a Modern Orthodox college prep school in Philadelphia with roughly 100 students that did not field a football team — Salz had an improbable mission. And, like always, he had a plan.Salz thought if he showed up every day and worked out as if he were on the team, he’d be noticed. But he didn’t leave it to chance. That fall, he attended then-head coach Jimbo Fisher’s weekly radio show at Rudy’s Country Store and B-B-Q to meet the man who would determine his fate.“I walked up to him and looked him in the eye and said, ‘I’m Sam Salz and I’m going to walk on to your football team,’” he recalled, ignoring a team policy requiring walk-ons to have played varsity football in high school.Fisher looked back at the undersized Salz, being more gracious than serious, and replied, “I’d be honored.”Salz kept returning to the radio show, the same way he would to that patch of land. He approached Fisher again and asked if he could attend practice to better understand what the Aggies did. Salz scribbled down what he learned and incorporated it into his independent workouts.The field Salz used was separated from the Aggies practice fields by a chain-link fence.“I told myself, ‘I’m on this team,’” Salz said. “They are practicing on that side of the fence, and I’m practicing on this side of the fence, but I’m on the team. That was my firm belief. I’d practice, and the energy was great. Guys would come out of practice and realize this guy in a yarmulke was working out every day, and they’d hype me up. Coaches would notice. I’d talk to the coaches.”Salz didn’t realize the coaches were talking about him, too.Salz, 21, became obsessed with playing college football at a young age, for reasons he can’t exactly pinpoint.“People talk about ‘Rudy’ to me all the time,” Salz said of the popular motion picture about a Notre Dame fan willing to do anything to make the team. “It’s funny, I’ve never seen it.”College football games largely fall on Shabbat — the Jewish Sabbath, observed from sundown Friday to sundown Saturday. As a result, he didn’t grow up watching the sport.AdvertisementFor an observant Orthodox Jew, Shabbat is an entire day meant for communing with God, whether it be studying Torah, praying or being with your community. Judaic law limits distractions. There’s no work, no lifting weights, no cooking, no cleaning, no business transactions, no usage of electricity and no riding in motorized vehicles, among other rules.And, obviously no playing football.

Sam Salz can suit up for the Aggies only after sundown for Saturday games. (Texas A&M Athletics)So, what drew Salz to Texas A&M?While in high school, Salz — like many other kids — got swept into the Dude Perfect craze on the internet. A group of friends took the web by storm by recording trick shots and putting them on YouTube. Salz learned that the members of Dude Perfect — now headquartered in Frisco, Texas — were college roommates at Texas A&M. Salz became infatuated with the school, a former military institution known for big-time ambitions, revered traditions, oil tycoons and Midnight Yell on Friday nights and Aggies football games on Saturdays.

Sam Salz started out as a running back but is now a wide receiver for the Aggies. (Texas A&M Athletics)He researched. The university has a total enrollment north of 70,000 students and there are an estimated 500 Jewish students on campus, according to the University’s Hillel website, less than 1 percent of the population.He reached out to Yossi Lazaroff, the rabbi of the Texas A&M Chabad. He concluded College Station was the right fit.“It was really about the culture, what the school represents and the alumni network,” he said. “It’s very different from any other school in America. It also has a strong Jewish community, even if it’s not large.”Salz said he felt a desire to prove to himself — and to other Orthodox Jewish people — that religious beliefs don’t have to infringe on goals or pursuit of happiness. For him, for some reason, that involved football.“I’ve always been a ‘see if I can do it’ type,” Salz said. “I don’t know how this got into my head. People think I’m BS-ing, but I always had this belief in my head, back to when I was a little kid, that I had to play college football or else I wouldn’t have done everything I could’ve — or should’ve — in life.”AdvertisementWhen Salz was a child, his school held a fundraiser selling cookie dough. The student who sold the most won a flat-screen television. Salz became obsessed and, with the help of a family friend who was an accountant, devised a sales strategy.“He won,” said his mother, Marianna Salz. “I’m of the mindset that if you want to try something, go ahead and do it. I know my son, so this wasn’t as big of a surprise and shock as it may have been for other people. He is a determined person. When he told me he wanted to do this, I was like, ‘OK, this is your next thing. Try it. Do it.’”Even with all of Salz’s planning, he never realized Fisher could see him working out from his Kyle Field office.“In the offseason, even on days we didn’t practice, he’d still come out there,” said  Mark Robinson, Texas A&M’s associate athletic director at the time and currently the chief of staff at Florida. “There’s a balcony that overlooks the field. (Fisher) would see him out there and just say, ‘That’s the same kid who comes to the radio show. He’s always working out, and I love his drive.’”When he first got to College Station in 2021, Salz took online classes at a Texas A&M system school and couldn’t try out for the football team until he became a full-time student on the main campus. And then before the 2022 season, Texas A&M had so many players in the program that it didn’t hold walk-on tryouts.But during a difficult 2022 season — one that would include a six-game losing streak — Fisher wanted to make a statement to the locker room. He wanted someone like Salz, who wanted something bigger than seemed possible and was willing to work for it, on his roster.“Halfway through the season, that’s when I got the text from Mark,” Salz said.The text from Robinson was simple: “Sam, do you have some time to come by the football offices today or tomorrow?”AdvertisementAs Salz responded yes and received more information about the walk-on process, he couldn’t contain himself.He screamed, jumped up and down and fist-pumped as hard as he could.Fisher and Robinson invited him on the team, even though he lacked the size and the experience necessary to compete in the SEC.“I don’t want to sound arrogant or self-aggrandizing when I say this. But there was something that I was willing to do that most people were not,” Salz said. “I made human connections and made myself a known person to them. I think (Fisher) appreciated that persistence. It was something old-school coaches would appreciate.”Salz never hid his faith, proudly wearing his yarmulke and tzitzit, the head covering and the knotted fringes or tassels on the Jewish prayer shawl that serve as reminders of the 613 commandments in the Torah. But he was initially worried that the coaching staff wouldn’t be understanding of the time constraints of his religion and his need to eat only kosher food.

Sam Salz attended a high school with roughly 100 students. Now he is on a team that plays in a stadium with more than 100,000 seats.Texas A&M, though, accommodated Salz. He isn’t expected to participate in team activities on Jewish holidays. The first practice after he was invited onto the team fell on Yom Kippur, and he didn’t attend. Team nutritionist Tiffany Ilten makes sure Salz has access to kosher meals, which they get from a distributor in Cherry Hill, N.J. A microwave in the team facility reads “kosher food only.”“Our main priority was making sure that all of our student-athletes are fed and nourished,” Ilten said. “It was a challenge at first, but not in a bad way. It was just something new we all had to educate ourselves on.”Salz and Robinson, who is also Jewish, connected by wrapping tefillin, small leather boxes and straps, around their arms and heads, symbolically binding themselves to God.Salz, who remains part of the program after Fisher’s November firing and the hire of Mike Elko, started out as a running back. He was brought along slowly, still lacking foundational football knowledge and the physical makeup to run between tackles. The longer he has been on the team, the more he’s been incorporated onto the scout team, where he’s likely to make his biggest impact.AdvertisementHe moved to receiver, where Texas A&M needed depth. He understands his physical limitations when matching up with elite athletes. But as he talked about it, he reached into his pocket and shared a clip of him running a drag route in practice and making a nice catch.“He goes hard all the time,” Texas A&M strength coach Tommy Moffitt said. “There is a size discrepancy between him and the other guys, but he doesn’t let that discourage him. The players have embraced him, and he works his tail off.”Added former A&M wide receiver Ainias Smith, a fifth-round pick of the Eagles in the 2024 NFL Draft: “We needed somebody like that on the team. Once people get here, it seems like everybody feels like they made it. His story motivates us to keep going.”Salz believes he is the only Orthodox Jewish player in college football. It’s not something that is tracked by the NCAA.Perhaps the biggest challenge for him is reconciling that no matter how good he gets, he will always have restrictions on game day. If the Aggies play during the day, he can’t attend because he’s observing Shabbat.For night games, he walks more than a mile from his apartment to Kyle Field. There are workers by the entrance who let him into the building — he can’t use his thumbprint scanners on Shabbat — and he finishes out the sabbath in the team rooms. He studies Torah, eats a meal and then gets suited up while the sun goes down. In the middle of the third quarter, he runs out of the tunnel and joins his team in his No. 39 jersey, yarmulke and tzitzit.“My teammates joke that in the new NCAA video game that my rating should be a 99 overall but I can only be used in the fourth quarter of night games,” he said.Salz has yet to appear in a game. He couldn’t participate in Texas A&M’s all-walk-on kickoff team (which paid homage to the 12th Man Kickoff Team from the 1980s) during its win over Abilene Christian last November because the game was during the day.AdvertisementSo why does he put himself through this routine if there isn’t the payoff of eventually playing?“I know why I’m doing it: for my Jewish brothers and sisters,” Salz said. “I knew I’d be in a position to inspire a lot of people.”(Top image Dan Goldfarb / The Athletic; Photo: courtesy of Texas A&M Athletics)

97,West Saratoga Is a Kentucky Derby Long Shot. But So Was His Trainer.,"The Athletic has live coverage of the 2024 Kentucky Derby, the 150th anniversary. LOUISVILLE, Ky. — Larry Demeritte bends over and unwinds the wrap circling West Saratoga’s right rear leg. He does the same to the left and then scoots under the horse’s belly to help Donte Lowery, his assistant, with the animal’s front wraps. The job finished, Demeritte stands in front of the horse and next to his brother Patrick, who helps with the horses, and smiles widely.A row of photographers squat next to Barn 42 and video cameras circle Demeritte as a boom mic stretches from its handler to poke in on Demeritte’s conversation. He is entirely unbothered by the production, as if somehow this attention is typical for a man who has two Graded Stakes wins throughout his four-decade career.AdvertisementPreternaturally positive and armed with a quip for every occasion, Demeritte is the feel-good story of this Kentucky Derby, and a story, frankly, horse racing could use. A year ago, the sport’s premier race went off under a shadow after 12 horses died in the week leading up to the Derby and five entrants were scratched by post time.Now here is Demeritte, a native of the Bahamas, in a profession in which Black trainers are a rarity; who has cancer for the second time while also in the throes of a rare heart disease; with a horse purchased for the price of a well-used Hyundai running in a field that includes a one-time yearling bought for $2.3 million; competing in his first Kentucky Derby 48 years after chasing a dream that took him out of a secure job in the Caribbean to the Churchill Downs barns.But Demeritte, 74, is more than a man with a good story and a willingness to tell it. He’s a man who understands this is all about so much more than him. “I always say,’’ Demeritte begins, using a favorite segue to deliver a message, “when you look on a tombstone, you see when you are born and when you die and the dash in between. That dash? It all depends on what you do in life in that dash.’’A simple wrought-iron gate opens off of East 7th Street in Lexington, leading not so much to a road but a pathway created by the ruts of tire tracks worn into the grass. African Cemetery No. 2 has functioned as a burial place since the early 1820s, and was turned over to the Colored People’s Union Benevolent Society No. 2 in 1869. Some 600 markers fill the 7-acre space, with plaques created to tell the stories of the names on the headstones. One, devoted to African-Americans in the horse industry, includes a list of 24 men who worked as thoroughbred trainers.In the early years of horse racing, Black trainers were commonplace, though many only learned their trade while tending to the animals of their slave owners. The first Kentucky Derby, in 1875, was won by Aristides, a horse trained by Ansel Williamson, who was emancipated 10 years earlier. But Reconstruction combined with Plessy v. Ferguson drove Black men out of their professions, many unable to get good horses or good rides. Most were forced backward in their career arcs, becoming grooms and exercise riders rather than trainers and jockeys. Demeritte is the first Black trainer with a Derby entrant since Hank Allen in 1989, and only the second since 1951.AdvertisementHe has climbed here the hard way, arriving in the United States from the Bahamas in 1976, buoyed by his late father’s horse knowledge and his grandmother’s positivity. Before Thomas Demeritte was killed while breaking a horse, he taught his son all he knew about horses, but it is really Mayqueen Demeritte who guided her grandson on his impossible dream. The family had no money – Demeritte spins a great tale about gathering cooked rice into a ball, wrapping it in a paper bag and then placing the makeshift ammo into a slingshot to kill a pigeon, which he’d then barbecue on a spit made out of a hanger. But they had each other and they had their faith. That, Mayqueen told the 13 grandchildren she raised, was more than enough to see them through. Her lone requirements were that the boys learn at least two trades, the girls secure an education, and they take care of one another for life. (They listened. Twenty of Demeritte’s family members will come from the Bahamas for the Derby.)Horses were more of a calling than a trade for Demeritte. So strong was his love for the sport, he gave up being a trainer in the Bahamas to work as a groom in the U.S. Hired by Lexington-based trainer Oscar Dishman, Demeritte joined a circuit that ran from Chicago to Florida and, eventually, to Churchill Downs.Demeritte, now standing near his Derby entrant, motions over his shoulder to the barns behind him that doubled as his home for two years, admittedly amazed at how far he’s come. In 1981, Demeritte went out on his own as a trainer. Well aware that the color of his skin made him an anomaly, he refused to view it as anything other than an opportunity. “I always say, if I could be linked with the negative side of my race, why don’t I want to link somebody with the positive side?” he says. “It’s not about me. It’s about bringing everyone of my race with me, so they could feel proud.”He says this as Lowery, his Black assistant trainer, finishes up West Saratoga’s bath. Lowery started working for Demeritte in 2015. His mother had died and, much like Demeritte, he longed for something bigger in horse racing. He left Charles Town track in West Virginia and headed to Kentucky. He started galloping for trainer John Mulvey, but when Mulvey went on to Florida, Lowery opted to stay behind and dig roots in Kentucky. He met Demeritte at the Thoroughbred Center in Lexington, the two bonding quickly over their love for horses and Lowery finding more than a boss in Demeritte. “That’s why I do what I do,” Demeritte says. “I don’t want Donte or my other (assistants) at the barn to have to wait this long to go to the Derby as a trainer.”

Larry Demeritte, right, with his father, Thomas, in the 1970s, preparing a horse for a race. (Matt Stone / USA Today)By 1996, Demeritte had amassed just 25 wins (for comparison’s sake, Todd Pletcher, the trainer of Derby favorite Fierceness, has won 67 races this year), but he was content. He was in the game, even if it was on the fringes in claiming and maiden races.That year doctors diagnosed him with bone cancer. The chemo treatments were excruciating and the prognosis grim. He joked with the doctors, arguing if they couldn’t tell him exactly how many rounds of chemo it would take to be cured, he’d decide when enough was enough. But he also admits that the disease occasionally tempered his optimism. His body racked with pain, he recalls going to sleep at night, wondering if he’d wake up the next morning. “I’m so sick and my prayer is, if I don’t wake up on this side, God will wake me on His side,” Demeritte says. He beat the cancer, only to have it return in 2018.AdvertisementSix years later, he still receives monthly chemo treatments – one as recently as the week before the Derby. He’s also been diagnosed with amyloidosis, a rare disease in which protein builds up in the organs; in Demeritte’s case, it’s affecting his heart. It helps that he lives close by. In 2000, he bought a 30-acre farm in Frankfort, about an hour’s drive from Louisville. He’s commuting daily to Churchill, and the chance to rest in his own bed is a blessing. So, too, is the normalcy of his routine. On Sunday, six days before the biggest day of his life, Demeritte went to church and then to Sunday school. He dismisses questions about his stamina, “I don’t have time to sit and worry about it,’’ but those close to him know the toll the illnesses are taking.“He’s been through some stuff, definitely,” says Harry Veruchi, West Saratoga’s owner. “This horse, it gives him a reason to go to work.”Veruchi met Demeritte in 2000, when Demeritte picked out a $3,000 horse for the Colorado-based owner. Daring Pegasus grabbed a second-place finish in a race for 2-year-olds on Derby day that year and went on to earn Veruchi $212,518, a rather sweet return on his investment. “We’ve been going ever since,” says Veruchi, who is retired from running a used car dealership.Veruchi grew up in Littleton, Colo., in a neighborhood that bordered Centennial Race Track. Most of the streets were named for tracks – Monmouth, Pimlico, Tanforan. Veruchi grew up on West Saratoga. As a 10-year-old, he sneaked into Centennial – you were supposed to be 16 – and gamely tried to convince someone to hire him. They shooed the pipsqueak away, though they gave his much older-looking and taller buddy a shot as a groom. Doug Peterson would go on to train Triple Crown winner Seattle Slew after the great horse’s storied 3-year-old run.Veruchi eventually pivoted to horse ownership, buying his first horse, Melb, in 1982. Like Demeritte, Veruchi largely competed away from the sport’s spotlight, in small stakes races. He and Demeritte have partnered off and on since Daring Pegasus, and the owner has learned to value his trainer’s integrity and trust his gut. “He’s a humble person, a religious person and a great trainer,” Veruchi says. “He really takes good care of this horse. He’s very in the game, making sure everything is right.”Three years ago, Demeritte made his annual visit to the Keeneland yearling sale. He knows what he likes in a horse, but he also knows what he can’t afford. “I always say, ‘I have Champagne tastes on a beer budget,’ so I buy good horses cheap, but that doesn’t mean I buy cheap horses,” Demeritte says. “I can’t afford the horses that have the papers, so I try to buy the horse that can make the paper.” He’s had good luck. Along with Daring Pegasus, Demeritte has turned other good investments, such as Lady Glamour – purchased for $1,000 and earning $126,000.But by the last day of the 12-day 2021 sale, Demeritte still hadn’t found a horse, and an anxious Veruchi kept calling, asking if anything had caught Demeritte’s eye.AdvertisementFinally, as the sale neared its finish with only 20 horses left, Demeritte spied a gray colt. Hip 4146, as he was listed, is the son of Exaggerator, the 2016 Derby runner-up and Preakness winner. The auction started, Demeritte bid and then fretted. “I kept saying, ‘Close the auction, man.’” Demeritte recalls with a laugh. “You selling this horse longer than any other horse come through here.” Demeritte purchased the yearling, which Veruchi named after the street on which he grew up, for $11,000 – or $2,289,000 less than the ownership group paid for Derby contender Sierra Leone.West Saratoga is 50 to 1. The eternal optimist Demeritte brushes off the oddsmakers’ opinions. As he always tells Veruchi, there is no Plan B. The only plan involves crossing the wire first, and fulfilling Demeritte’s master plan – to inspire. Inspire young people who hold dreams dear even if the path in front of them is bumpy; to inspire young Black men in horse racing by providing a familiar face to emulate; to inspire cancer survivors to ignore prognoses and diagnoses and just live.Those who love and care for Demeritte, though, would like to tweak the plan. Just this once they’d like it to simply be about Larry Demeritte. “I’m so happy to see he’s made it so far,” Lowery says. “Just being here is his dream come true, but Larry always says, ‘Nobody remembers who finishes second in the Kentucky Derby.’ I want him to have it all. I want him to win the Kentucky Derby.”The horse is a long shot. But then again, so was Larry Demeritte.(Illustration: Dan Goldfarb / The Athletic; photo: Matt Stone / USA Today)

98,The Knicks Have Made It This Far Because They Learn From Their Blunders,"“This was a really big test for us and we were able to come out on top,” Brunson said. “Going forward … it might be a different test, maybe something completely different. But this definitely helps, and obviously, you want to learn while winning, so obviously we’re still playing and we want to get better.”AdvertisementThis is why the Knicks expressed no interest in tanking out of the No. 2 seed at the end of the season. Others in the league, such as the Cleveland Cavaliers, feared the 76ers, who cratered to seventh place while Embiid was hurt, enough to intentionally lose on the final day of the regular season. But New York wanted this position.Now, this group is set up well because of its second-place finish.The Knicks pushed and shoved their way past the Sixers in Round 1. They own home-court advantage in Round 2 — and they’d have it even if the Pacers hadn’t upset the Bucks. The Knicks — yes, the New York Knicks — will be the favorites to go to their first Eastern Conference finals since 2000.But that doesn’t mean Indiana will be a picnic.The Pacers glide through games. They are speed demons in transition. The Tyrese Haliburton-Myles Turner pick-and-pop is among the NBA’s most dangerous actions. The Knicks will encounter loads of problems in Round 2 they haven’t seen before.A season ago, they faced a lower seed in the Eastern Conference semifinals, and it did not go well for them, losing to the Miami Heat in six. But the Knicks tend to learn from their mistakes.It’s a good trait to boast come playoff time.“In the playoffs, crazy stuff happens,” Thibodeau said. “And then it’s how you respond.”(Top photo: Bill Streicher / USA Today)

99,"Reasons for Every M.L.B. Team to Be Optimistic, and Pessimistic, This Season","Believe it or not, we have played five weeks of the regular season, and already we’ve seen enough to identify reasons for optimism and pessimism for all 30 teams.Is the glass half-empty? Half-full? From those at the top of the MLB power rankings to those at the bottom, every team has reasons for hope and concern in 2024.NL EastAtlanta BravesReason for optimism: The Braves have the best lineup in baseball one to nine, with athleticism, power and speed. They have a plus defender at every position and the depth to withstand injuries across the diamond. Ronald Acuña Jr., the reigning National League MVP, has only one home run, Matt Olson has hit .202, Austin Riley has hit .226 and yet Atlanta still sits in first place in the NL East at the start of May.AdvertisementReason for pessimism: They lost their ace, Spencer Strider, the oddsmakers’ early favorite to win the NL Cy Young Award, to season-ending elbow surgery. Although his absence shouldn’t stop the Braves from making the playoffs, it hurts their chances of defending their NL East title (they’ve won six in a row) — and more importantly, their chances of winning another World Series.GO DEEPERBraves' Spencer Strider candidly discusses his elbow surgery and pitching injury 'epidemic'Philadelphia Phillies

Led by ace Zack Wheeler, the Phillies’ rotation is off to a strong start. (Bill Streicher / USA Today)Reason for optimism: The Phillies have three starting pitchers (Zack Wheeler, Ranger Suárez and Spencer Turnbull) with ERAs under 2.00, along with Aaron Nola (3.20 ERA), Cristopher Sánchez (3.68) and Taijuan Walker, who has made one start since returning from the injured list. Overall, their rotation is 16-7 with a 2.50 ERA and leads the majors in strikeouts and batting average against. In the bullpen, José Alvarado has converted all five of his save opportunities, while righty Jeff Hoffman (1.29 ERA) and lefty Matt Strahm (1.50 ERA) have pitched well. In addition, third baseman Alec Bohm looks poised for a breakout season as he’s hitting .362/.432/.586 with four home runs and a team-leading 30 RBIs, which has lengthened the lineup.Reason for pessimism: Nick Castellanos is hitting .186. Bryson Stott is hitting .225. Kyle Schwarber and Bryce Harper are at .211 and .233, respectively. That’s not going to get it done if the Phillies want to finish ahead of the Braves this year.GO DEEPERJ.T. Realmuto offers a behind-the-plate view of the Phillies rotation's dominant 7-game runNew York MetsReason for optimism: Carlos Mendoza is doing a terrific job handling the pitching staff and dealing with adversity and has shown he’s one of the best rookie managers in MLB. The Mets’ starting pitching has been better than expected, most notably Luis Severino (2.31 ERA over six starts) and José Buttó (2.57 ERA, five starts). Edwin Díaz is healthy and has converted all four of his save opportunities, though he took the loss Monday against the Cubs.AdvertisementReason for pessimism: The Mets are middle of the pack in most offensive categories, and they’ve lost catcher Francisco Alvarez for significant time after he underwent surgery to repair a torn ligament in his left thumb. Most of their top prospects are not ready for the majors. Their record (16-15) reflects who they are and it appears they’ll hover around .500 all season. To me, they’re much closer to a fourth-place team than a third-place team. They also might have to consider trading first baseman Pete Alonso at the trade deadline if they’re out of contention as he’s an impending free agent and they haven’t been able to extend him.GO DEEPERThe top 100 potential MLB free agents for 2024-25 offseason — with options galoreWashington NationalsReason for optimism: CJ Abrams has become one of the most exciting offensive players in baseball, smashing seven home runs and stealing seven bases, which puts him on pace to join the 30/30 club. Jesse Winker looks like he could be a Comeback Player of the Year candidate, though he’s cooled off after a hot start. Left-handed starters MacKenzie Gore (3.19 ERA in six starts) and Mitchell Parker (2.53 ERA, four starts) look like they’re primed for breakout campaigns. In addition, top outfield prospect James Wood is ready to help the big-league team whenever the Nationals front office makes the phone call, as he’s hitting .314 with a .421 on-base percentage at Triple-A Rochester.Reason for pessimism: Patrick Corbin is once again one of the worst starting pitchers in baseball and for some reason the Nationals just won’t release him. Corbin, who led the NL in losses the past three seasons, has a 6.82 ERA over six starts. Josiah Gray, a 2023 All-Star, is on the IL with an elbow injury after going 0-2 with a 14.04 ERA in his first two starts.Miami MarlinsReason for optimism: The Marlins have one of the best young managers in the game in Skip Schumaker. They are improving their technology and analytics departments in the front office under first-year president of baseball operations Peter Bendix. Bryan De La Cruz and Jazz Chisholm Jr. are healthy and have the potential to live up to high expectations despite their slow-ish starts to the season.Reason for pessimism: The Marlins have a postseason-caliber rotation, but most of their starters are on the IL. Sandy Alcantara and Eury Pérez are out for the year after Tommy John surgeries. Jesús Luzardo (left elbow tightness) and Braxton Garrett (left shoulder impingement) are also on the IL. The Marlins were hoping to convert reliever AJ Puk to a starter but after going 0-4 with a 9.22 ERA in four starts, he, too, landed on the IL with a shoulder injury.NL CentralMilwaukee Brewers

Do the Brewers have enough starting pitching behind Freddy Peralta? (Charles LeClaire / USA Today)Reason for optimism: The Brewers have one of the top five offenses in the NL thanks to breakouts by catcher William Contreras (.345/.420/.538, five homers, 25 RBIs) and second baseman Brice Turang (.309 BA, .370 OBP, 14 stolen bases in 14 attempts). Willy Adames, an impending free agent, is also off to a fast start, hitting .278
with six home runs. First baseman Rhys Hoskins, who missed all of last season after knee surgery, has six homers and 18 RBIs and could become a Comeback Player of the Year candidate. Freddy Peralta has developed into a true ace; he’s 3-0 with 45 strikeouts in 33 2/3 innings.AdvertisementReason for pessimism: Their rotation has absorbed a lot of blows: Corbin Burnes is an Oriole; Brandon Woodruff is out for the year after undergoing shoulder surgery last October; Wade Miley will have Tommy John surgery and is done for the season. Meanwhile, DL Hall, one of the players acquired in the Burnes trade, has a 7.71 ERA over four starts, and veteran Joe Ross has a 5.40 ERA in five starts.Chicago CubsReason for optimism: Shota Imanaga looks like the best value signing of the offseason as he’s gone 5-0 with a 0.78 ERA and is pitching like he’ll be in the Cy Young Award conversation this year. Javier Assad has broken out this season with a 1.97 ERA over six starts and Jameson Taillon has impressed since coming off the IL, going 2-0 with a 1.50 ERA in three outings. Michael Busch was another shrewd offseason pickup by the Cubs; the former Dodgers prospect has six homers and 17 RBIs as their new first baseman.Reason for pessimism: Cody Bellinger is on the IL with a fractured rib, Ian Happ is hitting .211, Christopher Morel is at .209, Nick Madrigal is at .195. Nico Hoerner has yet to hit a home run and has been caught stealing twice in six attempts. (Last year he had an 86 percent success rate.)GO DEEPERFor Cubs’ Shota Imanaga, another win extends a charmed start to big-league careerCincinnati RedsReason for optimism: In April, Elly De La Cruz became the first player in MLB history to hit eight homers and steal 17 stolen bases in a calendar month. He’s the most exciting player on the Reds since Ken Griffey Jr. The team has held its own offensively despite losing Matt McLain and TJ Friedl to the injured list. The rotation has been solid, led by lefty Nick Lodolo (3-0, 1.88 ERA in four starts), while both Hunter Greene (3.63 ERA) and Andrew Abbott (3.27) are off to good starts through six outings apiece. Alexis Díaz has converted six of seven save opportunities despite some wildness.Reason for pessimism: Half of the Reds’ lineup just hasn’t hit to start the year. Will Benson is batting .206, Jonathan India .221, Christian Encarnacion-Strand .196 and Jeimer Candelario .194.St. Louis CardinalsReason for optimism: The three free-agent starting pitchers they signed have lived up to expectations to begin the year: Sonny Gray has quickly become their ace, posting a
3-1 record with a 1.16 ERA; Lance Lynn has a 2.64 ERA over six starts; Kyle Gibson has a 3.79 ERA and has eaten 38 innings. Ryan Helsley remains one of the most dominant closers in the game, converting 10 of his 11 opportunities.Reason for pessimism: The offense is just not clicking as the Cardinals’ two most proven veteran bats, Nolan Arenado and Paul Goldschmidt, aren’t hitting. Arenado has just one home run, and Goldschmidt looks like he’s in his age-36 season, as he’s hitting .230 with only two homers. The Cardinals also are not getting much help from their young players: Jordan Walker hit .155 before being demoted; Victor Scott II hit .085 before he was sent out; Lars Nootbaar is hitting .185 and Nolan Gorman .190. Only shortstop Masyn Winn and DH Alec Burleson have held their own at the plate.GO DEEPERThe evolution of Sonny Gray's many sliders: 'More velo, less movement'Pittsburgh PiratesReason for optimism: Rookie righty Jared Jones has been incredible, with 42 strikeouts to five walks over 34 innings and a 3.18 ERA in his first six starts. Paul Skenes, the top pitching prospect in baseball, has posted a 0.39 ERA through six starts at Triple A. He’s struck out 41 in 23 innings and is major-league-ready now. If the Pirates can get Mitch Keller straightened out after a slow start and promote Skenes, they might have the best top of the rotation, one to three, in the division, and might be able to stay in the NL Central race for most of the year.AdvertisementReason for pessimism: The Pirates are not getting enough offensive production from three of their best young players: Shortstop Oneil Cruz is batting .239 with three home runs, catcher Henry Davis is batting .162 and outfielder Jack Suwinski is also under the Mendoza Line, hitting .168. They’re also not getting much from veterans Andrew McCutchen and Rowdy Tellez, who are both hitting under .210.GO DEEPER'Sliders': How the Pirates are managing young arms, a Leiter family milestone and moreNL WestLos Angeles DodgersReason for optimism: The Dodgers’ lineup, one to four, is the best in baseball. Mookie Betts, the early front-runner for NL MVP, is batting .377 with 10 doubles, six home runs and eight steals in eight attempts. Shohei Ohtani is batting .336 with 14 doubles, seven home runs and five steals in five tries, Freddie Freeman is hitting .292 with an .833 OPS. Will Smith is batting .355 with 24 RBIs. Teoscar Hernández and Max Muncy have added six and five homers, respectively, in the bottom half of the lineup. Tyler Glasnow is in the early NL Cy Young Award conversation after going 5-1 with a 2.72 ERA over seven starts, while Yoshinobu Yamamoto and James Paxton are a combined 6-1 with a 3.31 ERA. Two-time All-Star Walker Buehler, who last pitched in 2022, is set to make his return from Tommy John surgery and start Monday against the Marlins. Closer Evan Phillips has converted all eight of his save opportunities and owns a 0.71 ERA.Reason for pessimism: Starting pitchers Tony Gonsolin, Clayton Kershaw, Dustin May, Bobby Miller and Emmet Sheehan remain on the IL without a return date.San Diego PadresReason for optimism: Manager Mike Shildt is doing an excellent job leading the Padres back into contention. Dylan Cease has become the ace of the staff, going 3-2 with a 2.78 ERA over six starts. Robert Suarez, their new closer, owns a 0.66 ERA and has converted all 10 of his save opportunities. Jake Cronenworth is having a bounce-back year and leads the team in RBIs (24). Jurickson Profar is off to a surprisingly strong start, hitting .342 with a .954 OPS in 111 at-bats. Rookie Jackson Merrill has made a smooth transition to playing center field while holding his own at the plate.Reason for pessimism: Veterans Fernando Tatis Jr., Manny Machado and Xander Bogaerts have been underwhelming overall; none of them are hitting above .250 nor have an on-base percentage over .325. They will have to dramatically improve for the Padres to secure a wild-card berth. Joe Musgrove has been a real concern in the rotation, posting a 6.37 ERA over eight starts with much slower arm speed out front than in the past.San Francisco Giants

The Giants’ offseason additions, such as Jung Hoo Lee, are paying off. (Nathan Ray Seebeck / USA Today)Reason for optimism: The Giants hit on most of their offseason moves. Jung Hoo Lee is playing above-average defense in center field and he’s tied for first on the team in hits. Matt Chapman and Jorge Soler have provided much-needed right-handed power, combining for nine homers. On the pitching side, converted reliever Jordan Hicks has put up a 1.59 ERA over six starts (34 innings). The only offseason move that hasn’t worked out early on is the signing of Blake Snell, who was rushed to the majors after signing late in spring training; he was shelled in his first three starts (11.57 ERA) before being placed on the IL with an adductor strain. However, he should return to his Cy Young-level form once he’s healthy and can build his arm strength. The Giants also have improved a lot defensively from last year.Reason for pessimism: Well, they’re in the same division as the Dodgers and both the Padres and Diamondbacks are capable of finishing ahead of them. And the Giants don’t have a single qualified hitter with an on-base percentage above .340. (LaMonte Wade Jr. leads the team with a .440 OBP in 84 plate appearances.)AdvertisementArizona DiamondbacksReason for optimism: Ketel Marte, Christian Walker and Lourdes Gurriel Jr. picked up where they left off last year. Marte is batting .307 with five homers, Walker is playing Gold Glove first base with seven homers, 22 RBIs and a .390 OBP, and Gurriel is swatting homers (five) and driving in runs (22). The top of their rotation — Zac Gallen, Jordan Montgomery and Merrill Kelly — should be formidable this season once they’re healthy and settle in. So far, Zac Gallen is 3-2 with a 3.38 ERA and Jordan Montgomery is 1-2 with a 5.63 in three starts since being activated, while Merrill Kelly went 2-0 with a 2.19 ERA over four starts before he was placed on the IL with a right shoulder strain.Reason for pessimism: They’ve been hit with a lot of injuries. In addition to Kelly, Eduardo Rodriguez (lat injury), their top free-agent signing, is on the IL and has yet to throw a pitch for Arizona. Others on the IL include closer Paul Sewald (left oblique strain), starter Ryne Nelson (elbow contusion), shortstop Geraldo Perdomo (meniscus tear), and outfielder Alek Thomas (hamstring strain). At the back of the rotation, Brandon Pfaadt and Tommy Henry have been inconsistent. Corbin Carroll, their best overall position player, is experiencing the “sophomore jinx” as opposing pitchers are getting him out early and often at the top of the strike zone. He’s batting .197 with one home run.Colorado RockiesReason for optimism: The Rockies are getting good production, offensively and defensively, up the middle: Ezequiel Tovar, 22, is batting .260 with three home runs and playing plus-plus defense at shortstop; Brenton Doyle, 25, is batting .300 with three home runs and playing plus-plus defense in center field; catcher Elias Díaz, who will be a free agent after this season, is batting .292 with 15 RBIs. The Rockies also just called up outfield prospect Jordan Beck, who had two hits in his debut Tuesday.Reason for pessimism: Nolan Jones, who joined the 20/20 club last year, was batting .170 with one homer when he went on the IL with a back injury. Age and decline have caught up with Charlie Blackmon, who is batting .217. Kris Bryant remains one of the biggest free-agent busts in recent years; he was hitting .149 with one homer before going on the IL once again. The Rockies’ rotation is 1-17 with a 6.46 ERA and the fewest strikeouts in the majors. The Marlins and White Sox are the only teams in MLB with a chance to finish with a worse record than the Rockies, who are currently 7-24.AL EastBaltimore Orioles

Corbin Burnes has been as advertised. (Tommy Gilligan / USA Today)Reason for optimism: The Orioles lead the American League in runs scored, home runs and OPS. Gunnar Henderson is a legitimate MVP candidate after starting the year by hitting .272 with 10 home runs. Adley Rutschman, the best overall catcher in the sport, is off to a fast start, hitting .310. The Orioles’ lineup is so deep that they have bench players as well as hitters in Triple A that would all be starting for most teams in the majors. Corbin Burnes is the front-runner for the AL Cy Young Award after a dominating start to his Orioles career.Reason for pessimism: The Orioles can’t keep the rest of the rotation after Burnes off the injured list. Kyle Bradish, their best starter last year, had spent the entire season on the IL due to elbow issues before making his 2024 debut on Thursday. However, Grayson Rodriguez is arguably their second-best starter and on Wednesday he went on the IL with right shoulder inflammation. (Lefty John Means was activated from the IL on the same day.) They need to get the rotation healthy if they’re going to achieve their ultimate goal of winning a World Series. In addition, bullpen depth is their weakest link and closing out games has been a problem as the Orioles already have blown seven save opportunities, including three by Craig Kimbrel.New York YankeesReason for optimism: Juan Soto has been the AL MVP thus far, slashing .331/.441/.589 with eight home runs and 25 RBIs. Anthony Volpe is raising his game offensively, batting .262 with three home runs and seven steals. Anthony Rizzo was the AL Player of the Week last week. The team is first in the AL in on-base percentage after ranking 10th last year. The pitching staff ranks third in the majors in team ERA at 3.07. The Yankees have been winning with their best starter, Gerrit Cole, on the IL and they’re hoping he’ll return by the end of the month if all goes well. Aaron Boone is once again proving why he’s one of the best managers in baseball in leadership, strategy and building team culture.AdvertisementReason for pessimism: They are in the same division as the Orioles and third baseman DJ LeMahieu continues his stay on the IL with a fractured foot.Boston Red SoxReason for optimism: The Red Sox lead the majors with a staggering 2.58 ERA after 32 games thanks to the leadership and direction of chief baseball officer Craig Breslow and pitching coach Andrew Bailey who have their pitchers filling up the strike zone with more secondary pitches than fastballs. They’re pitching ahead, getting early count outs, and pitch sequencing at an elite level. Kutter Crawford has a 1.56 ERA, Tanner Houck a 1.60, Cooper Criswell a 1.65 and Garrett Whitlock a 1.96. In addition, their best young starter, Brayan Bello, is 3-1 with a 3.04 ERA. Wow. Who saw that coming? Manager Alex Cora continues to push all the right buttons.Reason for pessimism: Trevor Story is out for the year after shoulder surgery, Triston Casas is on the IL with torn rib cartilage and Vaughn Grissom still hasn’t played a game for the Red Sox due to a strained hamstring. And, they’re in the same division with the Orioles and Yankees who have much better overall rosters.Toronto Blue JaysReason for optimism: Justin Turner has quickly become a team leader and one of their best offensive players, reaching base at a .376 clip with four home runs and 15 RBIs. They are also one of the best defensive teams in the sport, leading the majors with 85 defensive runs saved according to FanGraphs.Reason for pessimism: They are 26th in the majors in runs scored and 22nd in home runs. Their three best hitters have not produced to start the year. Bo Bichette is batting .205 with one home run, Vladimir Guerrero Jr. is batting .231 with three homers and George Springer is batting .212 with three home runs. The Blue Jays’ pitching staff is 11th in the AL in team ERA. Kevin Gausman (4.50 ERA) and Chris Bassitt (5.45 ERA) have not looked like themselves.Tampa Bay RaysReason for optimism: The Rays have one of the game’s best leadership teams with Erik Neander running the baseball operations department and Kevin Cash managing the club. Ryan Pepiot, acquired as the headliner in the Tyler Glasnow trade with the Dodgers, has more than lived up to expectations, posting three wins and a 3.12 ERA over his first six starts. Zack Littell has put up a 3.27 ERA in his six starts and Zach Eflin has lowered his ERA to 4.17 after a shaky start. Isaac Paredes has been their best offensive player, hitting seven dingers and leading the team with 17 RBIs.Reason for pessimism: The Rays’ offense outside of Paredes has not produced enough as they are 25th in the majors in home runs and tied for 21st in runs scored. They are expected to get back second baseman Brandon Lowe and right fielder Josh Lowe later this month after both sustained oblique injuries. In addition, their bullpen outside of Jason Adam and Garrett Cleavinger has been a huge disappointment and is not as dominant as it’s been in recent years.AL CentralCleveland GuardiansReason for optimism: They are in first place with the AL’s second-best run differential at plus-40. Josh Naylor is having a breakout-type season with a .347 OBP, seven home runs and 24 RBIs. Steven Kwan has been one of the game’s best leadoff hitters, batting .349 with 28 runs and José Ramírez continues to be one of the best all-around third basemen in the league. The bullpen is one of the best in the game with Emmanuel Clase logging an 0.55 ERA and converting nine of 11 save opportunities, Tim Herrin providing a 0.69 ERA, Hunter Gaddis with 17 strikeouts and three walks in 16 appearances and Nick Sandlin with a 2.35 ERA and 19 strikeouts in 15 1/3 innings.AdvertisementReason for pessimism: The starting rotation outside of Tanner Bibee has struggled; Logan Allen has posted a 5.11 ERA, Carlos Carrasco a 6.59 ERA and Triston McKenzie a 4.34 ERA. In addition, the bottom half of the Guardians’ lineup includes two hitters who are batting under .200, Tyler Freeman and Bo Naylor.Kansas City RoyalsReason for optimism: Their starting rotation and team defense have kept them in most games. Lefty Cole Ragans has posted a 3.44 ERA in seven starts, Brady Singer a 2.62 ERA over six starts and newcomers Seth Lugo and Michael Wacha have both delivered too. Lugo is 5-1 with a 1.60 ERA and Wacha has logged a 4.24 ERA. James McArthur won the closer’s job and has converted seven of eight save opportunities. Bobby Witt Jr. is now clearly a top-five player in the entire sport, hitting for both average and power, stealing bases and making highlight defensive plays daily.Reason for pessimism: Outside of Witt and team leader Salvador Perez, who is batting .355 with seven home runs, the Royals aren’t getting consistent offense. Maikel Garcia has four homers and 20 RBIs but is batting just .226. Vinnie Pasquantino has four dingers but a .221 average. MJ Melendez is hitting a mere .172 with four home runs and right fielder Hunter Renfroe is batting just .148.Detroit Tigers

Spencer Torkelson, who hit 31 homers last year, has yet to go deep in 2024. (Rick Osentoski / USA Today)Reason for optimism: The Tigers are fourth in the majors in team ERA at 3.12. Tarik Skubal has led the way, going 4-0 with a 1.72 ERA, and both Reese Olson and Casey Mize are pitching to ERAs in the low threes. James Foley has been excellent, closing games and converting all nine of his save opportunities. In addition, Riley Greene is blossoming into a star, reaching base at a .383 clip with seven homers and 15 RBIs.Reason for pessimism: The Tigers haven’t been able to get consistent offense as first baseman Spencer Torkelson has yet to hit a home run, center fielder Parker Meadows is batting .100, Javier Báez hitting .191 and rookie Colt Keith a dismal .160. They’ll have to get their offense going if they’re going to stay in the race all year.Minnesota TwinsReason for optimism: After a slow start and a boatload of injuries, the Twins have reeled off 10 wins in a row to get back in the race. Ryan Jeffers has led the way offensively, reaching base at a .393 clip with five home runs and a team-leading 19 RBIs. Edouard Julien got off to a slow start but now has five doubles and seven home runs. The Twins’ starting rotation also started slowly, but it looks like Pablo López and Joe Ryan, their two best starters, are turning things around. The addition of Simeon Woods Richardson has been a real plus as he’s put up a 2.45 ERA over his first three starts. The Twins’ bullpen has been dominant without their best reliever, Jhoan Duran, who was activated on Tuesday from the IL.Reason for pessimism: Royce Lewis, their best player, is on the injured list with a strained quad and there is no timetable for his return. The oft-injured Byron Buxton left Wednesday’s game with another knee injury. In addition, the back of the rotation, including Bailey Ober, Chris Paddack and Louie Varland, has struggled; Varland was already sent to the minors.AdvertisementChicago White SoxReason for optimism: They have a lot of new offerings at their concession stands including the Southside and Smoke House Smash Burgers, Ogden Foods Bratwurst, barbecue pulled pork and the Impossible dog. However, the best offering is the s’mores-inspired Campfire Milkshake, a chocolate shake with graham crackers, whipped cream, chocolate and a toasted marshmallow on top. You might have to watch a lot of losses, but at least you’ll have tasty food (if you’re there in person).Reason for pessimism: Their best player, Luis Robert Jr., is on the IL with a hip injury. Offensively, the White Sox are 30th in runs scored and OPS and 29th in home runs. On the pitching side, they are 29th in ERA, 28th in WHIP and last in the AL in walks allowed. Oh, and they have a bottom-third farm system.AL WestSeattle MarinersReason for optimism: They have the best starting pitching in MLB. Logan Gilbert is 2-0 with a 2.03 ERA, Bryce Miller is 3-2 with a 2.04 ERA, George Kirby and Emerson Hancock have been lights out over their past two starts, and Luis Castillo is among the league leaders in innings and remains the staff ace. The bullpen is deep and strong and closer Andrés Muñoz has converted five of six save opportunities. If the Mariners make the playoffs, they’ll be well-positioned to run the table with that type of dominant pitching.Reason for pessimism: Their offense leads the majors with 323 strikeouts and ranks 27th in on-base percentage, two areas they were hoping to improve in the offseason. Julio Rodríguez, like last year, is off to a slow start with only one home run, and 11 of their 14 hitters with at least 20 plate appearances are batting .222 or worse. They’ll need to acquire a bat or two between now and the trade deadline.Texas Rangers

Jacob deGrom’s potential return is a storyline to watch as the season progresses. (Joe Camporeale / USA Today)Reason for optimism: The starting rotation has been solid with Nathan Eovaldi, Jon Gray, Michael Lorenzen and Dane Dunning. (Andrew Heaney less so, but he pitched well his last time out.) Cody Bradford started 3-0 with a 1.40 ERA before a back injury put him on the IL. Kirby Yates has been dominant as a closer, converting five of five save opportunities, and David Robertson has been excellent in the setup role with a 1.08 ERA. Adolis García has been their best offensive player, reaching base at a .349 clip with eight home runs and 25 RBIs. It’s amazing how competitive they’ve been even though Corey Seager hasn’t started to hit yet, third baseman Josh Jung has played only four games, and rookies Evan Carter and Wyatt Langford are off to slow starts. The most important reason to be optimistic is Jacob deGrom, Max Scherzer and Tyler Mahle are all expected to return sometime later in the season, which will potentially be a game-changer for them, especially if deGrom can return to his Cy Young form.Reason for pessimism: Manager Bruce Bochy won the World Series in 2010, 2012 and 2014 during his tenure with the Giants, but never in back-to-back seasons. Was that because of a World Series hangover? Pitchers throwing too many innings the year before? Or just a coincidence? The Rangers’ season has started with many injuries and players underperforming, similar to what Bochy’s Giants teams went through during those odd years. However, I believe this team is too good not to find a way to at least make the playoffs.Oakland A’sReason for optimism: They have one of the best bullpens in baseball, led by rookie Mason Miller, who has converted all eight of his save opportunities while logging a 1.26 ERA and 29 strikeouts to four walks in 14 1/3 innings. Austin Adams has posted a 1.86 ERA in 14 appearances and Lucas Erceg has a 1.42 ERA in 13 games. If the A’s have a lead late, they can beat you.AdvertisementReason for pessimism: No one is showing up for home games and the A’s are 29th in runs scored and on-base percentage while striking out 309 times this year. Only three teams (the Mariners, Red Sox and Rockies) have struck out more.Los Angeles AngelsReason for optimism: Manager Ron Washington has brought positive energy and enthusiasm to the dugout. Jo Adell is having a great start to the season, hitting .290 with four home runs. Logan O’Hoppe is developing into one of the better young catchers in the league. Reid Detmers and Tyler Anderson have been solid and kept the Angels in most games they’ve started this year.Reason for pessimism: Shohei Ohtani is a Dodger. Mike Trout is back on the injured list with a torn meniscus in his left knee and first baseman Nolan Schanuel is hitting .227 with two homers. On the pitching side, Patrick Sandoval has a 5.91 ERA over seven starts and Griffin Canning has a 7.45 ERA in six starts.Houston AstrosReason for optimism: They’ve been to the playoffs each of the past seven years and have the experience to overcome adversity and their last-place start to the season. Jose Altuve, Kyle Tucker, and Yordan Alvarez are all doing damage offensively as expected and although Alex Bregman got off to a slow start, it’s hard to believe he won’t get going soon. Injuries to the rotation are mostly to blame for the poor start as Justin Verlander and Framber Valdez spent time on the injured list and Cristian Javier, Luis Garcia, José Urquidy and Lance McCullers Jr. are still sidelined. Their replacements couldn’t hold their own: J.P. France was optioned to the minors after going 0-3 with a 7.46 ERA, while Spencer Arrighetti is still with the big club but has an 8.27 ERA. Ronel Blanco has been the lone bright spot, going 3-0 with a 1.65 ERA. Interestingly, their back three relievers, considered the best trio in the sport going into the season, have been a disaster. Josh Hader has a 6.39 ERA, Ryan Pressly a 5.68 ERA and Bryan Abreu a 4.02 ERA. Once this pitching staff is healthy and pitching at full strength, the Astros should get back in the pennant race, no matter how difficult that looks right now.Reason for pessimism: The Astros are 11-20 and in a tie for last place. Only a handful of times in baseball history has a team dug a hole that big and still made the playoffs. Hunter Brown can’t seem to get on track in the rotation, going 0-4 with a 9.78 ERA, and first baseman José Abreu looks done as he was hitting just .099 when he accepted an optional assignment to the club’s spring training facility.GO DEEPERWhat early MLB trends should you believe, and not believe, as April turns to May?GO DEEPERThe 10 biggest disappointments of the young MLB season: bad umps, worse White Sox, A's to SacTown(Top image: Dan Goldfarb / The Athletic.

100,A Tale of 2 Photos: What Pictures Tell Us About a Young Soccer Star’s Attitude,"It was hardly incendiary stuff, and there is unlikely to be any lasting rancour between two players who had greeted each other warmly before kick-off. Yet the contrast between the image of Bellingham whispering in Kane’s ear in an effort to gain an advantage for his club and the picture of him putting his arm around the same player moments after he had missed a crucial late penalty against France in England’s 2022 World Cup quarter-finals defeat could not have been greater.Elsewhere on The Athletic…

They also speak to two sides of Bellingham’s personality, both of which have been evident in what is his debut season in Spain. There have never been any doubts regarding strength of character – his penchant for late goals, including in both La Liga Clasicos against Barcelona, is testament to that.While clearly enjoying the attention coming his way from his new club’s fans, Bellingham has also been praised for sharing the limelight: take, for example, his instruction for fans to applaud Fede Valverde for setting him up to score against Osasuna in October.GO DEEPERVinicius Jr is Real Madrid's transformative big-stage player - with a twistHe also provided a very unselfish assist for striker Joselu the following month, subsequently explaining that he wanted to help out a team-mate who had been going through a rough spell in front of goal.This looked like exceptional emotional intelligence and personal maturity, and helped make Bellingham phenomenally popular with Madrid players and supporters alike.AdvertisementHis gesture to Kane following that World Cup quarter-final penalty was significant, too. Bellingham – then aged just 19 – was the only member of the England side to console their captain after he failed to equalise in the 84th minute of what ended as a 2-1 loss, and it spoke to a maturity beyond his years.

Jude Bellingham consoles Harry Kane (Richard Heathcote/Getty Images)The flipside to all this, however, is that Bellingham can also come close to the line – or even cross it – when things are not going so well either for him personally or for his team.That was already signalled during his time at previous club Borussia Dortmund, when Bellingham was known to feel that some team-mates did not reach his own high standards — especially when they threw away a great chance to win the German title in May last year.Bellingham’s patience with Spanish referees also wore thin quite quickly. He felt he was not receiving enough protection as defenders used any methods they could to limit his influence on games.He picked up four yellow cards in six games through January and February, mostly for either dissent or ‘revenge’ fouls, serving a punishment for accumulation of bookings. Then came his most high-profile run-in with officialdom, when he was red-carded for furious protests after referee Jesus Gil Manzano whistled for full time just as he thought he had scored another late winner in a La Liga game against Valencia in early March.Bellingham was still raging as he left the pitch that night, quickly reposting an Instagram message which said: “The referee literally waited for Brahim Diaz to cross the ball! THIS IS A SCANDAL.” He quickly removed that message from his account, but he was still banned for three matches.GO DEEPERJude Bellingham is different - A portrait of Real Madrid's new superstarThere was also the incident when Madrid played neighbours Getafe in early February, and Bellingham clashed with fellow Englishman Mason Greenwood, during a bad-tempered game against a physical team.Getafe claimed that Bellingham had made an “offensive remark” to Greenwood, who joined the La Liga club on a season-long loan from Manchester United at the end of last summer’s transfer window. Greenwood had seen charges of attempted rape, assault, and coercive control dropped by the UK’s Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) in February 2023. He denied all the alleged offences.AdvertisementAfter a lip reader was consulted, the Spanish FA (RFEF) said no credible evidence of what Bellingham allegedly said to Greenwood had been found, and the case was dismissed.Bellingham received total backing from Madrid head coach Carlo Ancelotti and the club hierarchy after both the Greenwood and Mestalla incidents, and everyone at the Bernabeu has been keen to look after their latest emerging superstar.Fans of the club will also not be worried about any signs of being a bad loser, or even his taste for gamesmanship. Both fit perfectly with Madrid’s self-image as a place where winning is the most important thing (even as it goes against the ‘gentlemanly’ values that they also boast of).

Jude Bellingham does not lack confidence (Juan Manuel Serrano Arce/Getty Images)Bellingham’s career has been on warp speed so far – from becoming Birmingham City’s youngest first-team player just past his 16th birthday, to moving to Germany as the most expensive 17-year-old in history, playing for England at two international tournaments while still a teenager, and now making such a sensational start with Madrid.All this brings attention and pressure. Bellingham has mostly shown he can handle it, and channel whatever he is feeling into spectacular performances and moments for his team. Still, for all his many talents, he is not Superman, and there have been signs lately that he is feeling the strains of his incredible first season in Spain.He struggled to make an impact during the two Champions League quarter-final legs recently against Manchester City. And while he followed that with the last-gasp El Clasico winner 10 days ago, he was quiet again last night in his first game in Germany since leaving Dortmund.“Jude didn’t play at his best today, but he will be back very soon,” said Ancelotti, who also revealed Bellingham had been withdrawn because he was suffering from cramp. “He will be 100 per cent by Wednesday (the second leg at the Bernabeu next week).”AdvertisementCould Bellingham’s character lead to behaviour that might be better controlled? Maybe. And s***housing your national captain in a Champions League semi-final is probably not the wisest idea.But if Bellingham’s career has taught us anything, it is that he will do things his way.GO DEEPERInfuriating, embarrassing - and funny: What players really think of 'shithousing'(Top photos: TNT Sports and Getty Images)

101,The Unfortunate Reality Facing One of Baseball’s Best Players,"A trade of Trout, of course, was a long way from ever happening. To the dismay of many opposing fans, the three-time MVP and 11-time All-Star has steadfastly refused to ask out of Anaheim, maintaining he wants to spend his entire career with one team, like his boyhood idol, Derek Jeter, and win with the Angels.AdvertisementAt the start of spring training, Trout said he was “pushing, pushing, pushing” upper management to add free agents, an indication, perhaps, of his growing impatience. Well, his fuse needed to be shorter. He waited too long.For a trade scenario to become realistic, the following was necessary:• The Angels to stink again, which was all but a given.• Trout to A) return to near-MVP form, which at least stood a chance of happening before he hurt his knee; and B) request a trade, which even Angels fans would have understood considering he has never won a postseason game and not even appeared in the playoffs since 2014.• Angels owner Arte Moreno to demonstrate a willingness not only to grant Trout’s wish but also to include significant cash in a trade, which … was never happening.Moreno, remember, repeatedly declined to authorize a trade of Shohei Ohtani, even though it would have brought a monster return that could have kick-started his sorry franchise. He then declined to match the Los Angeles Dodgers’ $700 million offer to Ohtani with $680 million deferred, a deal that could very well pay for itself. Ohtani might not have taken the Angels’ money, mind you. But all the Angels will get back for him now is — yikes — the 74th pick in the 2024 draft.At a reduced annual salary — $15 million? $20 million? — some club still might want Trout. Trades involving major paydowns have been become increasingly common over the past quarter-century. Moreno has made some, sending the New York Yankees more than $28 million to dump Vernon Wells in March 2013 and $63 million to the Texas Rangers to get rid of Josh Hamilton in April 2015. Wells no longer was a productive player. Hamilton angered Moreno by relapsing into substance abuse. Trout, in contrast, is a model citizen and elite player when healthy, a Moreno favorite.AdvertisementFor Wells and Hamilton, the Angels received virtually nothing. For Trout, Moreno probably would want, oh, six top-100 prospects, particularly if he was parting with tens of millions to facilitate the deal. Trout’s actual trade value, even at a reduced financial commitment, would be much less. So, good luck talking Moreno into this. He wouldn’t trade Ohtani when, more than once, he had the chance to make the same type of deal the Washington Nationals made for Juan Soto.And now where are the Angels? Stuck with two players, Trout and Anthony Rendon, who combined are earning nearly $75 million annually through the completion of Rendon’s contract in 2026 yet cannot stay on the field. Which is where Trout’s tolerance for Moreno’s erratic stewardship becomes less understandable. The team is a mess, has been a mess, is going to be a mess for at least the next few years.The Athletic’s Keith Law ranked the Angels’ farm system 29th out of 30, ahead of only the Oakland A’s. Even if the Angels somehow turn it around by the end of Trout’s contract, how functional a player will he be in his late 30s? His early 30s sure have not gone well.In spring training, Trout told me he heard the noise about how he is content with the Angels, doesn’t want to win, won’t demand a trade. In an interview I conducted with him for Fox Sports, he said, “It fuels me more.” He was convinced he was about to return to form, saying he was getting chills just thinking about the possibility. And the way he was playing, a 50-homer, 30-stolen base season — proof he was still the GOAT, or at least, one of the top current players — seemed within his reach.His earnestness remains one of his most endearing qualities. The suggestion that he does not want to play in a more demanding market always seemed off to those who know him best, who see how hard he works, who witness his competitive fire. But Trout’s desire to succeed with the Angels instead of somewhere else seemed, to most on the outside, a fanciful notion.AdvertisementArmed with full no-trade protection, he could have leveraged his way to the Philadelphia Phillies, the team closest to his hometown of Millville, N.J. He could have blended in with a clubhouse full of hungry stars — Bryce Harper, Trea Turner and Kyle Schwarber, Zack Wheeler and Aaron Nola. And he could have been celebrated for escaping a bad situation rather than criticized for staying put.It didn’t have to be the Phillies. It could have been virtually any contender with payroll flexibility. And it didn’t need to get to the point of a trade. Trout twice signed extensions with the Angels when he could have become a free agent entering his ages 26 and 29 seasons. His loyalty was commendable. But at the moment, he’s looking like a modern equivalent of Ernie Banks, who holds the major-league record for most games played in a career without making the playoffs (2,528).Banks, playing in an era before free agency, never had the opportunity to choose another team. For most of his career, only the league champions made the playoffs, meeting in the World Series. He was a beloved figure, known as Mr. Cub. He made the Hall of Fame. But to many, there was always something missing, a what-might-have been aspect to his legacy.Trout, in the wake of his latest injury, is moving into similar territory. More than ever, he seems destined to remain Mr. Angel. As good as his intentions might have been, that’s a very sad thing to say.(Photo: Paul Rutherford / Getty Images)

Licht has been the Buccaneers’ general manager since 2014. In four of his first five seasons, Tampa Bay finished last in the NFC South. Now the Bucs have won the division three years in a row, and Licht seems to keep bringing in good players. This year, he got every analyst’s favorite under-the-radar offensive lineman, Duke’s Graham Barton.16.

The head coach of the NFL’s fastest team traded up to take the second-fastest running back in this year’s draft in Round 4 (Tennessee’s Jaylen Wright) and then drafted a high school sprinting state champion — Virginia wide receiver Malik Washington — in the fifth round. Give him credit, too, for getting big guys in the first two rounds in edge Chop Robinson and offensive tackle Patrick Paul.17. New York JetsPost-free agency rank: 15Brugler’s draft ranking: 17The Jets drafted an Aaron Rodgers support staff, getting offensive tackle Olu Fashanu, wide receiver Malachi Corley and running back Braelon Allen with their first three picks. Fashanu might not start right away, but he has that kind of talent, and Corley should join Mike Williams and Garrett Wilson in the starting lineup immediately.GO DEEPERWhy the Jets wanted 'YAC King' Malachi Corley no matter what in NFL Draft18. Pittsburgh SteelersPost-free agency rank: 22Brugler’s draft ranking: 2Whoever ends up playing quarterback for the Steelers (Russell Wilson and Justin Fields are the contenders, in case you hadn’t heard), he should have plenty of protection. Pittsburgh took three offensive linemen, including two of the feistiest in this draft (tackle Troy Fautanu and center Zach Frazier), with their first two picks.19. Seattle SeahawksPost-free agency rank: 18Brugler’s draft ranking: 16Seattle’s first two picks weigh a combined 614 pounds, so we know general manager John Schneider, in his first draft post-Pete Carroll, wanted to rebuild the Seahawks’ trenches. Defensive tackle Bryron Murphy II (6-foot, 297 pounds) might end up being the best defensive player in this draft, and guard Christian Haynes (6-3, 317) will provide immediate offensive line depth and a possible Day 1 starter.

Minnesota VikingsPost-free agency rank: 19Brugler’s draft ranking: 15If J.J. McCarthy is as good as (or even close to as good as) Kirk Cousins, the Vikings will have had the best draft of the year. If he’s not the guy, then Minnesota will have let a solid veteran quarterback leave and then expended a lot of draft assets only to fail to answer the quarterback question. Getting Alabama edge Dallas Turner at No. 17 is a nice touch either way.Advertisement21. Los Angeles ChargersPost-free agency rank: 26Brugler’s draft ranking: 6Jim Harbaugh stuck to his guns. After saying for weeks leading up to the draft that his team placed a premium on offensive linemen, he passed on two elite wide receiver prospects (Malik Nabers and Rome Odunze) to take offensive tackle Joe Alt fifth. “Offensive linemen we look at as weapons,” Harbaugh said. “Offensive line is the tip of the spear.”22. Atlanta FalconsPost-free agency rank: 17Brugler’s draft ranking: 32The talk of the draft, but not for the right reasons, the Falcons passed on their best chance to make the 2024 team better by drafting quarterback Michael Penix Jr. with the No. 8 pick. It might turn out to be a genius move for the future, but it won’t help this year with Penix sitting behind Kirk Cousins. The five front-seven defenders they drafted after Penix might help, though.GO DEEPERWhat's the Falcons' plan at quarterback after the NFL Draft's most surprising pick?23. Washington CommandersPost-free agency rank: 28Brugler’s draft ranking: 9The Commanders completed their extreme home makeover (the owner, general manager and head coach are all brand new) with their quarterback of the future. At least, that’s the hope. Former LSU quarterback and Heisman Trophy winner Jayden Daniels was the most physically dynamic quarterback on the board, but he does not come without risk. Should be a fun season in Washington, which would be new, too.24. New England PatriotsPost-free agency rank: 29Brugler’s draft ranking: 8The Patriots had the good fortune to be picking third in a draft that had three highly regarded quarterback prospects. And they had the good sense to simply take North Carolina’s Drake Maye instead of trading the pick. New England signed Jacoby Brissett in free agency, so it can afford to give Maye plenty of time to get ready before throwing him into an offense that isn’t good enough to help him as a rookie.Advertisement25. Las Vegas RaidersPost-free agency rank: 21Brugler’s draft ranking: 11The Raiders were rumored to be in the quarterback trade market but stayed in their draft slot and took the best player available — Georgia tight end Brock Bowers. It was a very un-Vegas move.

New York GiantsPost-free agency rank: 27Brugler’s draft ranking: 7The Giants passed on an opportunity to get out of the Daniel Jones business and really shake up the draft by taking a quarterback with the sixth pick. Instead, they went with dynamic wide receiver Malik Nabers in hopes he’ll help lift Jones to another level. If that doesn’t work, New York can exit Jones’ contract pretty easily after this year. It did bring in Drew Lock as a veteran contingency plan.28. Tennessee TitansPost-free agency rank: 24Brugler’s draft ranking: 26The Titans got bigger in the draft. A lot bigger, using their first pick on 342-pound offensive tackle JC Latham and their second pick on 366-pound defensive tackle T’Vondre Sweat. The Sweat pick in the second round (No. 38) raised eyebrows because he wasn’t expected to go nearly that high, but if he matures and can keep his weight in check, he could be a superstar. Latham is expected to be a Day 1 starter.29. Arizona CardinalsPost-free agency rank: 31Brugler’s draft ranking: 5AdvertisementThis was the draft Arizona had been waiting for. The Cardinals had seven of the first 90 picks. Teams generally hope to get at least starting-quality players out of that type of draft capital. If Arizona did that, its turnaround could begin now.30. New Orleans SaintsPost-free agency rank: 30Brugler’s draft ranking: 19The Saints might have stumbled into their next starting quarterback … or into a quarterback controversy. New Orleans drafted South Carolina’s Spencer Rattler with the 150th pick. Given current starter Derek Carr’s sometimes shaky hold on the job and Rattler’s NFL arm, Saints fans might be calling for a change by midseason.31. Denver BroncosPost-free agency rank: 25Brugler’s draft ranking: 31The Falcons’ quarterback selection kept Denver off the national hot seat. The Broncos took Oregon quarterback Bo Nix at No. 12, which was 32 spots higher than The Athletic’s Dane Brugler had him ranked. If it works, Sean Payton can turn Denver around quickly.

103,How Ohio State Became the Biggest Winner of the College Football Off-Season,"The 1870 Society has only been around since the spring of 2023, so Stetson said they don’t have a lot to compare it to, but this year’s NIL fundraising has been substantial.“I think there’s been some real extraordinary support,” Stetson said. “There’s been a huge influx of $10 a month and the bigger ticket purchases, as well. Regardless of trending year over year the support has been incredible.”Everything is working for Ohio State now, but there are constant conversations about what’s coming next and accounting for the possibility of donor fatigue. Stetson said that’s where creativity on part of the collectives comes into play.GO DEEPER‘My gripe is with the system’: Why some fans are resisting giving money to NIL collectivesThe Foundation, for a week in January, matched all donations that were made. It ended up matching the $500,000 that fans donated, which also included a donation from former quarterback C.J. Stroud. In total, The Foundation raised more than $1 million in a week. It’s now in the middle of another matching promotion, which will extend to the end of May and has raised around $220,000 as of April 30, according to Schottenstein.AdvertisementBut more than just asking for donations, both Ohio State collectives have hosted events with the proceeds going toward NIL. In July, The Foundation will host what it calls “The Fantasy Experience,” which will allow participants to go behind the scenes like a prospective recruit to see what goes into a game day at Ohio State, meet alumni and more. In March, The 1870 Society, with the help of the football program, sold tickets to a tour of the Woody Hayes Athletic Center, which included meet-and-greets with players and coaches.Stetson said he sees it as the collective’s job to find creative ways to raise money without always asking donors directly for money.“It’s about creative events or opportunities for fans to get access or create new content, or being very engaged with the business community across the country, or how can we tap into what NIL is intended to be?” Stetson said. “I would hope that a donor-centric model has built a bridge and on the other side of that bridge is a more sustainable model.”Regardless of what’s next, Ohio State is in a position to chase a national championship now with one of the best rosters in the country after watching its archrival win one last season. It happened thanks to a combination of strong recruiting, player retention and transfer portal success.Amid the angst of losing to Michigan, Gene Smith hopes he helped put Ohio State on stable ground as former Texas A&M athletic director Ross Bjork gets set to take over this summer.“Where we are with football, not winning Big Ten championships, I wanted to make sure that we did everything we could to make sure football has a real chance next year,” Smith said. “When I think about my legacy, I think about that. I hate to leave Ohio State when football is not back to winning Big Ten championships.”GO DEEPERWhat happened to Deion Sanders' Colorado castoffs?

104,The Premier League Salary Cap and the $500 Million Elephant in the Room,"Premier League clubs this week opted to push on with plans for a hard spending limit — a de facto salary cap tied to the income of the lowest earning side in the top flight.OK, we hear you say, but what on earth does it all really mean?Who better to answer your questions than Matt Slater, who broke the original story? If you prefer, you can listen to Matt for free on Apple Podcasts, Spotify and the usual listening places on The Athletic FC Podcast.Let’s dive in…What are the real motivations for such a rule? — Adam M Do I detect a note of suspicion, Adam?For some, such as Crystal Palace chairman Steve Parish, who has been talking about this idea longer than most, there are sincere concerns about the competitive balance of the league.They worry that the revenues of the ‘Big Six’ — which already feels like a ‘Big Seven’ and might be a ‘Big Eight’ before long — are growing faster than the revenues of the Premier League’s middle and lower classes, and that is before you factor in the increased sums they will receive from playing more Champions League games and occasional appearances in the FIFA’s revamped Club World Cup. Financial fair play regimes that tie your ability to spend to your own revenues play into the big clubs’ advantage, which compounds with each passing year.AdvertisementSo, “anchoring” is an attempt to slow the big clubs down. It’s a backstop to the squad cost rule that UEFA has already introduced and the Premier League is moving towards. The two are meant to be complementary, with anchoring being the backstop — a hard cap that even the richest/most successful/most ambitious club cannot go beyond.

The night Sancho reminded the world (and Manchester United) of his brilliance
What is the role of the Professional Footballers’ Association (PFA)?  — Peyton B Is there any chance the PFA will agree to a hard spending limit of 5x? And, if yes, what concessions would they require from the owners? — Dave DThe PFA calls itself the players’ trade union and it is, officially, the world’s oldest players’ union. But it has spent most of its history acting more like a lobby group, with a large charitable arm and growing education and healthcare sections. Unlike the North American players’ unions, it has not engaged in big disputes about profit-sharing with the clubs, the players’ employers, and it has not signed formal collective bargaining agreements with them.Instead, there is almost a gentleman’s agreement between the leagues, on behalf of the clubs, and the PFA that the former will fund the union’s work in looking after former professionals who need new hips, providing counselling for those who need it, funding grants for second careers and backing research into conditions such as dementia.The PFA, unsurprisingly, hates the idea of salary caps. Would you like it if a third party said your employer was not allowed to pay you over a certain level, even if that employer wanted to and could afford it?

Erling Haaland with the 2022-23 PFA Player of the Year award (PFA)This is why European football’s governing body UEFA and everyone else have always had to step carefully when introducing cost controls. To avoid breaking European Union and national laws on restraint of trade, governing bodies have neeed to prove that what they are doing is justified by a legitimate aim — the sustainability of a culturally significant industry — and the proposed measure is fair, proportionate and transparent. In other words, they cannot push it too far.AdvertisementSo, rules that tie a club’s ability to spend to its ability to earn have, until now, been OK with lawmakers, as there is a clear link to sustainability. But linking a club’s ability to spend to someone else’s earnings? Hmmm. Debatable.And it is almost certainly a debate the PFA will enter. As things stand, it is aware of the Premier League’s anchoring proposal and some preliminary conversations have taken place, but it is adamant that a proper consultation on the matter, at the relevant body, has not started.The body in question is the ‘Professional Football Negotiating and Consultative Committee’, which is comprised of members from the PFA, the English Football League, the English Football Association and the Premier League. It is where all matters relating to employment in the game are discussed. If its members cannot agree, the dispute goes to independent arbitration. And there has been a lot of that in football of late.Which clubs will benefit the most and the least from this? The clubs that objected to this seem very different, so it’s hard to tell — Andrew RGood question!Crystal Palace chairman Parish clearly believes it will help his team continue to compete in the Premier League. Anything, even something as loose as the proposed 5x anchoring cap, will help Palace put out a competitive team every week in the Premier League.And every other team in Palace’s tax bracket seems to agree. For them, letting Manchester City and the rest spend 70 per cent of their ever-growing total revenues on their squads will destroy what is left of the jeopardy when City meets a team from the league’s lower half.But the other big potential beneficiaries of anchoring are those clubs directly competing with Manchester City right now, and worried about the rising threat of Newcastle United. They want to tie their rivals to a more transparent cost-control mechanism. So, this would explain the support from Arsenal, Liverpool and Tottenham Hotspur.Manchester United would ordinarily be in that gang but their new increasingly de-facto owner INEOS is concerned about anchoring slowing down its ability to perform the radical surgery United’s squad requires. So, their opposition is more tactical than strategic.

Sir Jim Ratcliffe, part-owner of Manchester United (right), with Sir Dave Brailsford (Robin Jones/Getty Images)Aston Villa’s opposition to the idea is interesting as it reveals just how ambitious their billionaire owners Wes Edens and Nassef Sawiris are for the club. In the past, Villa would have been in favour of something that constrains the league’s elite. Now, they see themselves as potential aristocrats.AdvertisementAnd Chelsea, well, they abstained probably because they realised a vote against the idea was not going to stop it from proceeding to the next stage in the consultation and legal process, so there was no point voting against it. But, equally, they could hardly back a rule that they are probably the only club to be in immediate danger of breaching. So, they did neither and abstained.Will the players not just go to a league without a cap? — Darragh NAll of them, Darragh? And where? Which league pays average salaries anywhere near as high as the Premier League?I understand the concern, and it will be voiced as a reason not to do this by those who hate the idea. I just do not think it is very likely.According to the most recent data from UEFA, 10 of the top 20 wage bills in European football are in the Premier League. No other league has more than three representatives.The two biggest wage bills in Europe, and therefore global football, are at Barcelona and Paris Saint-Germain, but they can only field 11 players at a time, and both are trying to trim their wage bills, with Barca badly needing to stop their slide towards bankruptcy and PSG moving towards a more sustainable model.GO DEEPERWho is the best-paid player at every Premier League club?Nothing lasts forever, of course, but there is no evidence of any short- or medium-term threat to the Premier League’s status as the richest domestic league in global football.Could the Saudi Pro League be the threat? It might, one day, but I would argue there is just as much chance of the SPL going the same way as the Chinese Super League in a decade as there is of it becoming a genuine challenger to the Premier League, La Liga, Bundesliga and other major leagues.If I were in charge of the Premier League, I would be more worried about Major League Soccer but, as we know, North American sports owners love cost controls, so I cannot imagine them getting into an arms race for players with the Premier League, particularly as half of those owners are likely to own Premier League teams, too.GO DEEPERIt's a controversial topic, but does taking a Premier League game to the U.S. make sense?How punitive are these rules on the richer clubs? A circa £500m limit on spending is hardly forcing teams to scratch around the bargain bin — Tom NI think you have answered your own question, Tom. And the answer is… not very! Not yet, anyway.We have estimated each club’s squad cost calculation for the 2022-23 season. The numbers that go into that calculation are the wages for your first-team squad players and coaching staff, your annual amortisation bill (the cost of your transfers spread across the length of their contracts) and any agents’ payments you make.Now, some of those numbers are publicly available but we have had to make educated guesses on the biggest one, the wage bill, as clubs only publish their total wage bills — for all their staff — and not what they pay their players. However, most clubs spend about 70 per cent of their total wage bill on their players, so that is the amount that we have used.AdvertisementThe result is that only Chelsea spent more than five times what the Premier League’s bottom club, Southampton, received from the league in central payments. The Saints’ share of the league’s broadcast and sponsorship cash was £103.6million, which would have set a 5x cap at £518million. Chelsea’s estimated squad cost that season was £539million.So, no, you’re right, if the only club to possibly breach the proposed anchor was Chelsea, after their wild shopping spree, this would not appear to be particularly restrictive.Curious how it will work, timing-wise. Will they confirm the amounts available to spend the next season, once the season is over? — Courtney AYou are not the only one to be curious about the details of this, Courtney, and you ask a good question.Whether the Premier League bases the cap on the multiple of the previous season’s bottom club’s central income or an estimate of the new season’s bottom club’s number is not clear yet. But I do not see how they can set the cap retrospectively. Clubs must know where they stand, so the cap will have to be set in advance.I wonder if the cap should be linked to rolling three-year domestic TV rights deals.The actual calculation is not that difficult, as most of the numbers are easy to predict. Every club receives a basic award of about £90million, with each place in the table worth a £3.1million merit payment, so the bottom club gets 1 x £3.1million and the top club 20 x £3.1m.The only real variable is the facility fee, as that is the payment clubs receive each time they appear on live television in the UK, and it is not often the case that the team that finishes 20th is the least-picked team.The facility fee is just over £1million a game and every team is guaranteed a minimum number of televised games. The range for facility fees in 2022-23 was £25.3million (Manchester City) to Bournemouth (£10.2m).AdvertisementSo, there is some variability in the exact amount your bottom club will earn but not much. The facility fees make up 25 per cent of amount clubs make from the domestic deal, which is about half of the total income. As previously mentioned, Southampton received £103.6million last season and that seems like a good benchmark for a bottom-placed team in the current broadcast rights cycle.How will this new rule tie in with UEFA’s rules? Could you have a situation where a team spends more than £500million and wins the Premier League fairly but is not allowed to play in Europe? — Ben HThis proposal will work in tandem with UEFA’s squad cost rules and the Premier League’s version of the same concept. Think of anchoring as a backstop or a relatively distant line in the sand that nobody can cross.Your second question is an intriguing hypothetical but does not seem very likely to me.Even if we ignore the numbers and just pretend that there is a way for a club to emerge from the pack and win the league, while breaching UEFA’s 70 per cent threshold, do not forget that winning the league will bring a big TV merit payment, increased commercial income and the promise of at least £45million of Champions League prize money.So, they might bust the 70 per cent limit in the year they win the Premier League, but they are unlikely to do so the following season. We have a very recent example of such a club: Leicester City. They made a record profit the year after they won the Premier League.Finally, even if your champion still, somehow, manages to breach UEFA’s threshold, the European governing body does not like banning champions from its competitions. It has a long track record of dishing out fines, which they collect by withholding some of the prize money, and squad restrictions.This approach is actually baked into the new squad cost rules, as UEFA has published a penalty schedule that links the size of the fine to the scale of the breach. (Top photo: Michael Regan/Getty Images)

105,What Is ‘Queer Food’? A Conference Explores (and Tastes) Some Answers.,"When Sasha DuBose uses the word “queer” to talk about food, it’s a verb, not an adjective. To Ms. DuBose, queering food is “taking how we define food and how we engage with it and twisting it, making it more fun.”To them, queer food is also okra.“They way you slice into okra and it’s crunchy and ooshy-gushy — a lot of people think it’s weird,” said Ms. DuBose, a nonbinary transgender lesbian who will soon graduate from the food studies program at New York University. “But okra is queer.”Queer food can be so many things, depending who’s cooking, eating or serving. During the inaugural Queer Food Conference at Boston University last weekend, queer food was defined as meals made by queer chefs and home cooks. But it was also far broader, almost without boundaries. It was the pie thrown in the face of the anti-gay rights activist Anita Bryant, the gastro-narratives of queer people in El Paso, Texas, and the food served at “topless lesbian gatherings,” as one panelist described it.“Queer food defies categorization, and that’s its beauty,” said Megan J. Elias, who organized the conference with Alex D. Ketchum, an assistant professor at the Institute for Gender, Sexuality and Feminist Studies at McGill University in Montreal.Ms. DuBose and Ms. Elias were among the some 160 food scholars, writers, students and industry professionals who paid $45 apiece to gather online and in classrooms and a cookbook library. The mostly Millennial and Gen Z attendees considered food (pie, seaweed), food culture (potlucks, cookbooks) and food spaces (a co-op, clambakes) through queer, Marxist, feminist and anti-colonialist perspectives.ImageSasha DuBose, left, a student in the food studies program at N.Y.U., was among the speakers.Credit...Kayana Szymczak for The New York Times",By Erik Piepenburg,2024-05-02 12:56:03-04:00,dining,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/02/dining/queer-food-conference.html,The New York Times
106,Lavender Is the Springtime Answer to Pumpkin Spice,"A year ago, Jonathan Grahm, a chocolatier, visited Paris and noticed the ubiquity of lavender in French soaps and lotions. He wanted to add a floral-leaning chocolate to his lineup at Compartés, a confectionery shop in Los Angeles established in 1950, and figured that lavender was his way in.Mr. Grahm harnessed his inspiration into a lavender white chocolate bar using flower buds from farmers’ markets in California. It was a tricky experiment, but now the pastel-purple bar is one of the company’s most popular, with more than 10,000 sold in the last year. For Mother’s Day, Mr. Grahm has doubled down, creating a floral-themed holiday box featuring a chocolate truffle made with grapefruit and lavender.“Lavender is a really beautiful scent,” he said. “I really wanted to translate that to a chocolate.”ImageThe lavender white chocolate bar introduced last year at Compartés has quickly become one of the company’s most popular.Credit...CompartésIn the fall, consumers clamor for anything with the warm flavors of pumpkin spice. But as tulips and daffodils start to blossom, lavender, a member of the mint family, has become the taste of the season — even though the plant doesn’t bloom until the summer.Starbucks, Bluestone Lane, About Coffee and other craft coffee shops have introduced exceedingly popular lattes and matcha drinks featuring the flower.

107,This Pie Maximizes the Best Part of Spanakopita,"Lovers of Greek phyllo pies know that pleasure can hinge on a crust’s ample surface area — but the key to maximizing this? A spiral.A standard slice of phyllo pie offers a soft filling blanketed by flaky, tender, delightfully oily crust on the bottom, top and maybe — if luck delivers an edge or corner piece — a side or two. But a spiraled pie lavishes its admirers with perfectly proportioned bites, each with a satisfying ratio of phyllo to filling.The golden spirals known as striftopites (the collective name for “twisted pies”) will appear on many lunch tables across Greece on Orthodox Easter — this year, on May 5 — alongside the compulsory sweet tsoureki loaves and platters of spit-roasted lamb, ending 40 days of Lenten fasting. (In the Greek Orthodox tradition, that means abstaining from products derived from red-blooded animals. For some of the strictest observers, that even includes olive oil, which was historically transported in goat-skin containers.)Recipe: Spiraled Spanakopita With FetaTo make a striftopita, a cook spreads a savory or sweet filling onto thin dough, which is rolled into a loose log, then coaxed into a ruched spiral. The pie is usually baked — sometimes fried — for a crisp exterior that yields to tender filling. Lots of olive oil or, less often, butter is involved. The crevices between rings allow fat to penetrate the dough, adding flavor and flakiness. And in sweet pies, those gaps provide a path for the pastry to evenly absorb the sugary syrup.",By Brian Levy,2024-05-02 05:02:35-04:00,dining,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/02/dining/greek-orthodox-easter-striftopites.html,The New York Times

In France, with cheese shops, bakeries and fine prepared foods available in every neighborhood, it’s easy to have an impromptu picnic — at a park, in the woods or on a river bank — at the drop of a (straw) hat.All of the dishes here are strikingly Francophile. But as a colleague mentioned to me, it’s not fancy or fussy, it’s just good, simple French food. I see it as a buffet, served in the backyard with everything at room temperature, though it could also easily travel to the beach. And if you get rained out, it’s still delicious indoors.I want vegetables at my picnic, so there are two salads in this menu.Recipes: French Potato Salad | Cherry Tomatoand Green Bean SaladImageThis straightforward, old-fashioned French potato salad is tossed with chives and tarragon, and finished with a generous amount of olive oil.Credit...David Malosh for The New York Times.

109,I Let TikTok Tell Me Where to Eat. Here’s What I Learned.,"TikTok is many things: a place for slime videos, a free therapy session, the leading source of information in America right now, and, for some, the ultimate restaurant resource. With a properly tuned algorithm, TikTok can become a never-ending scroll of rhythmic recommendations from critics of varying reliability, many of whom have been paid by restaurants for their P.R.-approved opinions.How trustworthy are their suggestions, really? And what can a diner expect from these spots, when videos have promised them perfect vibes, hot singles and even religious enlightenment? To find out, I spent hours on TikTok, going down a digital rabbit hole of restaurant videos, then dined for a week at the whim of my For You Page.‘New York’s hottest new restaurant’Meduza MediterraniaThistle Swann and Jacob Cummings, who met on Hinge, put their faith in the internet once more to choose their anniversary dinner locale. “I just looked up ‘fancy restaurants’ on TikTok,” Mr. Cummings said. “I don’t know anything about fancy culture, but I could tell by looking at the place that it was dummy fancy.”That’s how the couple, both 25, found themselves below a huge fake tree sprouting from the middle of the dining room at Meduza Mediterrania, a clubstaurant in the meatpacking district with a strict dress code (no sweatpants, shorts or jerseys) and a pricey raw bar.Meduza’s website calls it “a dining experience that takes you on a journey to a world of sunlit coasts, sparkling waters and vibrant culture.” I didn’t find any geographic marvels, but I was surprised to find the food (shiso tzatziki, lamb chops with chimichurri, wagyu kafta) terrific.",By Becky Hughes,2024-04-30 14:03:22-04:00,dining,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/30/dining/tiktok-fyp-restaurant-recommendations.html,The New York Times
110,"Goodbye, Gas. The Future of New York City’s Pizza Is Electric.","Something is changing about New York City’s pizza.It’s not the continued farmers’ market-ification of ingredients, nor is it the ever-expanding definition of what can go on a pizza (ham and horseradish cream, anyone?). It’s not the natural wine pairings, or even the buzzy, inventive pop-ups.Instead, the ovens themselves are in transition.“The most famous version of pizza from New York is the gas oven pizza — the pizza by the slice, the pick-it-up-and-fold-it-grease-running-down-your-arm version,” said Scott Wiener, who leads pizza tours in the city.But some of New York City’s most accomplished pizza makers have seen the writing on the wall: Gas isn’t getting any cheaper. Wood- or coal-fired pizza ovens, long-revered as the gold standard, are increasingly rare. And now electric ovens — once mocked as an Easy Bake-esque cop-out — are on the rise.ImageUpside Pizza, a New York chain known for its sourdough pies and fancy ingredients, recently switched from gas ovens to electric ovens.

113,The Best Ways to Cook Asparagus,"The first blush of asparagus season never gets old. Every April, seeing those violet-tipped bunches at the farmers’ market sends my pulse zipping and my mind whirling. Dreaming up new ways of preparing them is almost as thrilling as eating them, though clearly not as satiating.Because asparagus cook so quickly and are delightful at any stage of doneness — crisp-tender, velvety soft and even raw, if very fresh — they take well to a host of techniques.Lately, roasting has been my go-to. It’s not necessarily easier or faster than any other method, but I love how the oven’s heat intensifies asparagus’ flavors, caramelizing and sweetening the stalks while the tips get crispy. It’s also convenient. Asparagus roasts beautifully at any temperature from 375 degrees to 450 degrees, which means I can throw a pan of oiled, salted spears into the oven along with whatever else I’m making for dinner. Add a drizzle of yogurt or good olive oil, and some chopped herbs or scallions, and you get a nearly effortless side dish with charm and sophistication.This spring, though, I wanted to focus on some other cooking techniques that would both highlight asparagus’s versatility and coax a wide range of qualities from the leaf-green stalks.BroilingI started with broiling, which is roasting-adjacent. But where roasting surrounds the stalks with relatively even and gentle heat, broiling blasts them fiercely and directly, singing them until blackened outside, tender and sweet within.Broiled asparagus has an intense flavor, so I wanted to match it with a pungent sauce. While the spears were under the broiler, I whisked together a simple miso glaze, flavored with sake, mirin and sesame oil, and brushed it on during the last few minutes of cooking. To make the dish more substantial (and for a soft, mild contrast), I added tofu.",By Melissa Clark,2024-04-26 13:42:43-04:00,dining,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/26/dining/best-ways-to-cook-asparagus.html,The New York Times
114,José Andrés Eulogizes 7 Aid Workers Killed in Gaza,"A stone pulpit in the National Cathedral in Washington, D.C., is no place the chef José Andrés expected to be when he created the food charity World Central Kitchen nearly 15 years ago. But on Thursday he stood there, eulogizing seven of the organization’s workers who were killed in the Gaza Strip while trying to carry out a singular mission: bringing food into a region of 2.2 million people facing a growing humanitarian crisis.“They risked everything to feed people they did not know and will never meet,” Mr. Andrés said. “They were the best of humanity.” The seven workers were killed on April 1 after they helped unload a barge of food aid in northern Gaza and were heading to the southern city Rafah. Their well-marked convoy of vehicles was hit by armed Israeli drones. Israeli military officials said the attack was a serious mistake that shouldn’t have happened. They cited a series of failures, including a breakdown in communication and violations of the military’s own rules of engagement.An unusually subdued and occasionally tearful Mr. Andrés said he was consumed with regret, sorrow and anger over the deaths. “I know there are also many questions about why World Central Kitchen was in Gaza,” he said. “We ask ourselves the same questions day and night.”But the workers took the risk, he said, because they believed that showing up to feed people in their darkest hours would let them know they weren’t alone.“Food is a universal human right,” Mr. Andrés said. “Feeding each other, cooking and eating together is what makes us human. The dishes we cook and deliver are not just ingredients, or calories. A plate of food is a plate of hope. “",By Kim Severson,2024-04-25 15:24:27-04:00,dining,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/25/dining/jose-andres-wck-workers-gaza.html,The New York Times
115,There’s History in These Cheese Pulls,"Leer en españolSofia Head grew up watching her grandfather lead the carne asadas, her family cookouts, in Monterrey, Mexico. He manned a charcoal grill for hours, cooking carne asada for dozens of relatives. One of her favorite dishes was his queso fundido: melted Chihuahua cheese in a cast-iron skillet that he left on his grill until the queso’s edges became crisp and the center was bubbly.“We couldn’t have a carne asada without the queso fundido,” said Mrs. Head, who holds smaller carne asadas at her home in Fort Worth, where she’ll occasionally make the side dish with diced jalapeños and chorizo.Recipe: Mushroom Queso FundidoQueso fundido is a popular appetizer at many Mexican and Tex-Mex restaurants in the United States. The gooey cheese is served in its cast-iron skillet with tortillas or chips. Its roots go back to the Mexican Revolution, which began in 1910, said Carlos Yescas, who studies and writes about Mexican cheese. The revolutionaries gathered in the central part of the country, near Mexico City, where they made easy meals like queso fundido.Their travels throughout the country, aided by Mexico’s train system, helped spread queso fundido to northern Mexico and South Texas, where today it is normally served with chorizo on top and a red chile salsa and corn tortillas on the side, Mr. Yescas said.",By Christina Morales,2024-04-25 13:47:36-04:00,dining,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/25/dining/queso-fundido.html,The New York Times

This week, he discusses the surprising science of salting scrambles.Q. Should I add salt to scrambled eggs before cooking, during or after? — Ashley Allison, ChicagoA. “Don’t season it,” a young Gordon Ramsay warns in the viral video that has no-doubt landed his soft scrambled eggs on countless breakfast tables. Salt “breaks down the eggs” and turns them into “something very watery,” he says sternly, adding that salt should be added during the last moments of cooking. In a different scrambled egg tutorial, he claims that salt added too early will make the eggs “go gray.” Is he right? Will seasoning eggs before cooking them ruin them?As with most simple questions, the answer can get quite complicated.Recipe: Extra-Creamy Scrambled EggsLet’s start with the quick version: It doesn’t really matter.

118,"Chicken katsu, weeknight rescue","ImageCredit...Linda Xiao for The New York Times. Food stylist: Monica Pierini.Of all the crispy fried cutlet variations that have tantalized me over the years, Kay Chun’s chicken katsu might be the most weeknight friendly. Instead of turning to the usual messy deep-fry, Kay shallow-fries the cutlets by using just enough oil to submerge them halfway. The thin disks of meat emerge golden, crunchy and juicy inside, ready for their customary accompaniments of steamed white rice and a shaggy mound of shredded green cabbage. Kay provides a recipe for tonkatsu sauce (a tangy Japanese barbecue condiment with Worcestershire and ginger), but it’s easy to buy a bottle if you want to save a step.Featured RecipeChicken KatsuView Recipe →Pounding meat into thin cutlets is one age-old path to speedier cooking; using ground meat to make meatballs is another. For a lighter, brighter take on the usual meatballs in tomato sauce, I have a gingery, cumin-scented version that calls for fresh tomatoes rather than canned. I created this recipe to use up all those overripe summer beauties that usually congregate on my countertop, threatening to leak their sweet juice if they soften faster than I can eat them. But this dish works well with firmer fresh tomatoes, too, or even with the stalwart cherry or grape tomatoes that I buy all year long. A finishing squeeze of lime juice and a scattering of cilantro take this far from spaghetti-sauce territory, in the very best way.For a midweek meal without meat, Hetty Lui McKinnon’s mushroom pasta stir-fry shows how versatile stir-frying can be, brilliantly using the technique to make a simple but deeply flavored pasta sauce out of mushrooms seared with fragrant Chinese five-spice powder and drizzled with a mix of maple syrup, soy sauce, and chile and sesame oils. The broccolini introduced near the end stays bright green and crisp, adding texture and freshness to this earthy, hearty dish.Want dinner even faster than that? Try Kay’s vegan coconut-caramel braised tofu — it’s ready in 20 minutes. Kay is a master at coaxing complex flavors out of just a few ingredients. Here, she chars green beans until they start to blacken, giving them a smoky flavor that carries into the miso and the coconut milk-based sauce. Serve these pillowy tofu cubes over rice for dinner, and then save the leftovers to toss with noodles for tomorrow’s lunch, an unbeatable two-for-one meal deal.",By Melissa Clark,2024-05-01 11:00:18-04:00,dining,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/01/dining/chicken-katsu-weeknight-rescue.html,The New York Times
119,"Come on, Kids. Let’s Grab Drinks.","The first time Tom Mathe, head bartender at L’Avenue in Manhattan, saw a child order a mocktail, he didn’t know what to think.“There was this initial impulse of, ‘Wait, is this OK?’” he said. “I wouldn’t explicitly target children as a demographic when I make any kind of drink.”Yet more and more he has noticed children asking for nonalcholic drinks. “It’s not exactly daily, but more than weekly,” he said.The restaurant, which sits inside Saks Fifth Avenue, has two spirit-free concoctions on the menu. Most children get the “Mr. Tastee,” Mr. Mathe said, which comes with coconut, vanilla, bergamot orange and soda. It makes sense, he added, considering that he created it with his own childhood in mind: “It reminds me of waiting for an ice cream truck.”He ultimately decided that while it still feels a little strange to serve the sophisticated beverages to children, it felt satisfying to contribute to family dining experiences “in an interesting way.”As nonalcoholic cocktails, wines and beers have become staples on bar menus across America, some children — people way under the legal drinking age — have begun to partake.",By Alyson Krueger,2024-05-04 05:02:14-04:00,style,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/04/style/nonalcoholic-drinks-kids-mocktail.html,The New York Times
120,"Punchy, Potent Tuna Puttanesca","ImageCredit...Armando Rafael for The New York Times. Food Stylist: Cyd Raftus McDowell.Good morning. The Kentucky Derby is on Saturday, the first since last season’s spectacularly sad and difficult outing. I’m about as good of a handicapper as I am a heart surgeon, but here’s my bet: Fierceness, trained by the horseman Todd Pletcher and ridden by the four-time Derby winner John Velazquez. I’ll tip my mint julep to that team at the start of the race and, if I’m not celebrating a couple of minutes later, I’ll still be eating maple-pecan bourbon balls for the win.That’s all in the future, though, where everything is seashells and balloons, a dream to hold onto until it shatters, my own little sequel to “Uncut Gems.” In the meantime, there’s dinner to make here at the end of the week: tuna puttanesca (above), spiced brininess with caper pops and olive depth, fiery as you like.There are a couple of excellent details in Lidey Heuck’s recipe for the dish. She uses shallots to enhance the garlic punch beneath the salt and tang, and she doesn’t stint on the anchovies. I like a full half dozen myself, as well as jarred tuna in oil if I can find it, for the chunkiness it brings to the sauce.Featured RecipeTuna PuttanescaView Recipe →Will I start Saturday with my recipe for sourdough waffles, made with some of the starter that sits, deep in chilly slumber, in a jar in my fridge? I will, because I’ll start them after I’m done cleaning up the puttanesca.

121,What to Know About ‘Unfrosted’ and the Real History of Pop-Tarts,"First, there was the Flamin’ Hot Cheetos biopic (complete with an Oscar-nominated song). Then came “Tetris”; “Air,” about Nike Air Jordan sneakers; “BlackBerry”; and “Barbie.”It is, in other words, a golden age for product-origin-story movies.The latest is “Unfrosted: The Pop-Tarts Story,” a satirical history that Jerry Seinfeld has expanded from his stand-up act. The film, which he directed and stars in alongside Jim Gaffigan, Hugh Grant and Amy Schumer, arrives Friday on Netflix. Unlike its predecessors, it’s not really concerned with actual events. Here’s what to know about the true history of the Pop-Tart — and what the movie gets right and wrong.But first, how did Kellogg’s and Post both end up with headquarters in Battle Creek, Mich.?You would think ground zero in the Breakfast Wars of the 1960s might be somewhere most people could locate on a map. But Battle Creek, Mich., was home to the Battle Creek Sanitarium, known for its water and fresh air treatments, and managed by Will Keith Kellogg and his brother, John Harvey Kellogg. W.K. Kellogg developed a method of creating crunchy pieces of processed grain for his patients (read: Corn Flakes), and one of those patients, C.W. Post, would go on to start his own company in 1895 selling several foods that were veeeery similar to those at the sanitarium.W.K. Kellogg noticed Post profiting from his recipes and established his own firm in 1906, the Battle Creek Toasted Corn Flake Company. Within three years, it was cranking out more than 100,000 boxes of Corn Flakes a day, and, thanks to the success of Kellogg, Post and many other cereal companies, Battle Creek became known as the Cereal City. Who were the real Edsel Kellogg III and Marjorie Merriweather Post?ImageMelissa McCarthy, Seinfeld and Jim Gaffigan in “Unfrosted.”Credit...Columbus 81 ProductionsThe bumbling chief executive of Kellogg’s, played by Gaffigan, is fictional (thank goodness). On the other hand, Marjorie Merriweather Post — the General Foods owner whom Schumer portrays as a turban-wearing caricature — was one of the first female chief executives and, for most of her life, considered the wealthiest woman in America.

122,"In Los Angeles, a Hilltop Garden Party With a Tower of Crudités","Southern California’s infamous Santa Ana winds were barreling through Los Angeles as Sara Kramer and Sarah Hymanson prepared to host a garden party to celebrate the May 7 release of their first cookbook, “Kismet.” But as seasoned chefs and restaurant owners — they opened their Middle Eastern-inflected East Hollywood restaurant, also called Kismet, in 2017 after bonding in the kitchen at Brooklyn’s Glasserie over a decade ago — the two women have plenty of practice keeping cool in stressful situations. “We were like, ‘It’s going to die down, it’s going to die down,’” said Hymanson, 37, of the gale. “And if it doesn’t, then we’ll figure it out.”Indeed, just before 5:30 p.m., when guests were set to arrive at the Echo Park hilltop home that Kramer, 38, shares with her partner, the comedian Emil DeRosa, 34, and their goldendoodle, Kevin, the gusts subsided and the gray skies gave way to a golden sunset. Suddenly, the garden — which features a winding pathway scented by jasmine bushes and herbs that leads down to a grove of loquat, fig and Blenheim apricot trees — felt like an ideal place for a celebration. Chase Valencia, 40, who co-owns Lasita, a modern Filipino restaurant in the city’s Chinatown, took in the setting, admitting, “I came to this dinner because I really wanted to check out her house!”ImageA trellis of jasmine flowers frames a seating area in the garden.Credit...Stephanie NoritzImageAn arrangement by the florist Yasmine Khatib featuring poppies, butterfly ranunculus and foxgloves in the home’s living room.Credit...Stephanie NoritzImageKhatib carrying the arrangement into the garden.Credit...Stephanie NoritzThough they enlisted their friends and fellow chefs Kali Bush-Vineberg, 31, and Patch Troffer, 38, to help cook at the event, Kramer and Hymanson had prepped from sunrise to midnight the day before, making an early morning trip to the Santa Monica Farmers Market and then spending hours chopping produce and converting the measurements from their cookbook to accommodate a large party. “We tested the recipes plenty of times,” Hymanson said, “but we were still anxious about it.” The book, they said, was a labor of love five years in the making, a project they signed on for in 2019 but put on hold during the pandemic and the expansion of their business, which has grown to include three fast-casual Kismet Rotisseries over the past four years.",By Jean Trinh,2024-05-02 16:22:58-04:00,t-magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/02/t-magazine/kismet-los-angeles-garden-party.html,The New York Times
123,Three Choices for World-Class Art and a Nosh,"Sometimes, in the rush and mundanity of life, it can be easy to forget that we live in one of the world’s cultural capitals. Last month, I went to the Museum of the City of New York for the first time, and visited the Neue Gallerie afterward to check out the “Klimt Landscapes” show. I was excited to take in history and the arts, but even more excited to be taking full advantage of the city.Depending on where you live, these spots can be a schlep — but I say commit to the schlep, and I’ll make sure you’re eating well along the way. There are surprisingly good dining options at some of our fine cultural institutions, some of them new, most of them old, all of them better than you’d expect to find at a museum.ImageThe Black-owned vegan food truck Aunts et Uncles will pop up outside the Brooklyn Museum on Fridays and Saturdays this summer.Credit...Marcus LloydAunts et Uncles at the Brooklyn MuseumDid you know that the Brooklyn Museum is currently showing the collection of Swizz Beats and (Tony nominee) Alicia Keys through July 7?

124,Welcome to the Mushroomhouse,"ImageCredit...Ryan Liebe for The New York Times. Food Stylist: Simon Andrews.Tucked into a brightly lit hotel bar recently, I struck up a conversation with a lively tourist on a mission: She needed to find the best steak au poivre in the city, and she needed to find it stat. The thought of that earthy sauce has only occasionally withdrawn from my mind since. But the classic French preparation comprising black peppercorns, Cognac and cream needn’t be reserved for meat.Many a vegetable will au poivre nicely, I imagine. (I’d like to try it on steaks of cauliflower or eggplant, planks of zucchini and bundles of blistered asparagus, for starters.) But perhaps the one best suited to the sauce is also the most obvious — the mushroom.Meaty in texture and deeply savory in flavor, simply seared portobello caps are primed for the au poivre treatment, as Ali Slagle proves with her vegetarian take on the dish. The comment section is full of raves, as well as smart vegan modifications: “I substituted cultured vegan butter and made a simple cashew cream to substitute the heavy cream,” wrote Lola, a reader who declared the dish “INCREDIBLE.”“Alongside sautéed spinach and mashed potatoes, I felt like I was at a vegetarian steakhouse,” wrote Elise, another reader. “I’ll definitely make this again.” It is, coincidentally, one of my favorite vegetarian recipes for conjuring the warmth of a dimly lit, wood-paneled restaurant — but it is not the only one.Ali’s sheet-pan gnocchi with mushrooms and spinach (above) is up there, a hearty interpretation of traditional steakhouse sides that are, in my humble opinion, as much a draw as anything else on the menu. The store-bought gnocchi are a cheeky, weeknight-friendly nod to perhaps everyone’s favorite steakhouse stalwart — the baked potato — and, when tossed in a sauce of mustard, horseradish and honey, they steal the show with ease.",By Tanya Sichynsky,2024-05-02 13:00:05-04:00,dining,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/02/dining/welcome-to-the-mushroomhouse.html,The New York Times
125,Sheet Pan Your Sandwich,"ImageCredit...Johnny Miller for The New York Times. Food Stylist: Rebecca Jurkevich.Is a sandwich dinner? I don’t mean to open the floodgates of food-based existential inquiry, but it’s something I’ve wondered in my more navel-gazy moments. I’m always down for a grilled cheese to go with my tomato soup, or a fried egg on toast to nestle next to a salad, but those are more accompaniments than main events. Headlining sandwiches — bánh mìs, Cubanos, cemitas, tuna crunches or egg salads — I tend to save for lunch. And then there’s the whole “is a hamburger a sandwich” question, which I will not be wading into today.Anyway: Ali Slagle’s sheet-pan Italian sub dinner is definitely a dinner. (It’s right there in the name.) All the elements are there: salami, red onions, pepperoncini and tomatoes, plus radicchio and chickpeas, crisped and caramelized in a hot oven and tossed in a classic oregano-garlic vinaigrette. Serve, as Ali suggests, with a big scoop of ricotta or a shower of Parm, and with extra vinaigrette for drizzling or swiping. You’ll also want bread, whether it’s torn in generous hunks or split open for sandwich making is entirely up to you and your dinner-sandwich philosophy.Featured RecipeSheet-Pan Italian Sub DinnerView Recipe →A roast chicken dish is always dinner, and Yewande Komolafe’s garlic chicken with guasacaca sauce is a bright, tangy, fantastic one. Guasacaca, a Venezuelan condiment, combines avocado, jalapeño, vinegar, lime, parsley and cilantro for a lush green sauce that’s paired here with roasted chicken quarters and carrots, though it’d be wonderful on seafood, meat, or grilled veggies. Or take this tip from Rosh, a reader: “Leftover guasacaca? Put it on grilled cheese with some pepper jack … thank me later.”Let’s keep that sheet pan busy: Melissa Clark’s new miso-chile asparagus with tofu dresses singed, broiled asparagus stalks and tofu cubes in a pungent miso sauce sweetened with mirin and spiked with rice vinegar and chile. Her baked fish and chips is no less satisfying in terms of oomph and zip, the zip here coming from an easy homemade horseradish tartar sauce.The weekend is almost upon us, which means we can start daydreaming about long, luxurious breakfasts. (Even if our actual weekend mornings are more hectic than hedonistic.) I’m aiming for a cartoonishly tall stack of Klancy Miller’s fragrant orange cardamom pancakes, crowned with chopped dates, a smear of orange marmalade and a heavy halo of maple syrup. If the reality is more a messy pile without the accompaniments, I’ll still be happy; those pancakes are dreamy enough.And Christian Reynoso’s quick smoked salmon tart is a clever take on the classic bagel with lox, relying on store-bought puff pastry to form the base of this elegant and effortless brunch dish. It would also, as one reader mentions, be a very nice appetizer at a dinner gathering, or even dinner itself.

My parents did, too — they were high school sweethearts — and their stories about hitchhiking to Nags Head as teenagers in the 1960s and seeing bands like the Drifters perform at the local dance hall were the stuff of legend in my mind. As a kid in the ’80s, I loved climbing the massive sand dunes at nearby Jockey’s Ridge State Park and fishing at Cape Hatteras. So I was excited to learn that this month, Steidl will publish a book of images the photographer Joel Sternfeld took in Nags Head in the summer of 1975. Sternfeld’s weatherworn cottages and roadside snack bars bring back memories real and imagined, and I’ll enjoy reliving them with my mom. The book is currently available for preorder, so, in the meantime, I’m eyeing some other ’70s-inspired gifts for Mother’s Day. Vacation’s Orange Gelée sunscreen is reminiscent of the vintage tanning staple Bain de Soleil, and this portable wine chiller designed in 1978 by Richard Carlson is easy to find on eBay. It fits two bottles of wine. Alternatively, Cann Social Tonic’s zero-proof Roadie pouches, infused with 2 milligrams of THC, travel easily to the beach. And for a nostalgic summer pants set, turn to the Rockaway Beach-based Zingara Vintage. The designer Erin Silvers custom makes her ZingaraTerry loungewear from vintage YSL towels produced in the 1960s and ’70s.Garden PartyIkebana Essentials From the Fashion Designer Ulla JohnsonImageItems from the Ulla Johnson x Niwaki collection.

Ikebana, which Johnson studied during the coronavirus lockdown in 2020, is a minimalist style of floral arrangement that dates back to sixth-century Japan. Four years after she began the practice, Johnson still arranges flowers from her own Brooklyn backyard as often as possible. “I start each day in the garden when I can, gathering stems and branches to bring light and life into the house,” she says. Her collection with Niwaki features ikebana essentials, including secateurs (hand pruners) wrapped in wisteria rattan, a shallow vase handmade by the Japanese potter Yo Thom and a gardening apron made of Ulla Johnson’s shibori fabric, which shows up frequently in her ready-to-wear clothes. The Ulla Johnson x Niwaki ikebana collection will launch May 6 in Johnson’s New York and Los Angeles boutiques, as well as at Niwaki’s London flagship, which Johnson will take over with a window installation designed by the florist Frida Kim.Bar CrawlFruity Green Soaps to Brighten the BathImageFrom left: Terra-Tory Wild Heirloom Tomato and Sweet Basil Soap Cube, $20, terra-tory.com; Soft Services Green Banana Buffing Bar, $33, softservices.com; Wary Meyers x D.S. & Durga Pistachio Glycerin Soap, $20, dsanddurga.com.Credit...Courtesy of the brandsBy Caitie KellyDeliciously scented and with a dose of nourishing ingredients, these bars of soap turn hand washing (or showering) into a pleasurable part of any routine.

The scent is bright, green and slightly sweet — just like a freshly peeled, unripe version of its namesake fruit. The Long Island-based company Terra-Tory’s seasonal Wild Heirloom Tomato and Sweet Basil soap uses puréed, vitamin C-rich tomatoes sourced from a local farmer’s market alongside sweet basil oil, cracked black pepper and anti-inflammatory nettle leaves.

127,Make a Great Taco Even Better With Jackfruit,"In the middle of the 14th century, on a journey through India, the Florence-born friar Giovanni de’ Marignolli came across a fruit he’d never seen. It was “as big as a great lamb, or a child of 3 years old,” he wrote. “You have to cut it open with a hatchet.” The reward was “a pulp of surpassing flavor, with the sweetness of honey, and” — a pang of homesickness? — “of the best Italian melon.”The object of his desire: jackfruit, as it came to be known in English, most likely from chakka, its name in the Malayalam language. But despite the good friar’s enthusiasm, in the centuries that followed, jackfruit never quite won a place in the hearts and kitchens of the West. Unlike fellow tropical fruits, like the banana (“the most delicious thing in the world,” Benjamin Disraeli, a future British prime minister, declared in 1831) and the pineapple (“a pleasure bordering on pain,” the English essayist Charles Lamb rhapsodized in 1888), it remains beloved mostly by those who live where it grows.Recipe: Jackfruit TacosPerhaps to outsiders, it appears forbidding. Its reptilian hide evokes the flank of a dormant dragon. Its fragrance when ripe is, how shall we say, strong. (Like the durian, it has been banned from airplane cabins.) Then, too, there is the issue of its unwieldy size. The jackfruit is a giant: the largest fruit borne by trees. The heaviest specimen on record, documented in the western Indian state Maharashtra in 2016, measured nearly two feet long and more than four feet around, and weighed 94 pounds 2.9 ounces, according to the Guinness World Book of Records. Rivals for the title include a 144-pounder reportedly sighted at a jackfruit festival in the southern Indian state Kerala in 2010. Kerala is where the American poet and essayist Aimee Nezhukumatathil first tasted jackfruit, at age 8. She was visiting her paternal grandparents, whom she knew through the carefully typed aerogrammes they mailed her every few months. Their neighbors didn’t quite know what to make of this half-Indian, half-Filipino girl from Chicago, who had bobbed hair and wore shorts and pink glasses (“too much reading,” her mother explained). Then they watched her devour jackfruit and understood that she was one of them after all.",By Ligaya Mishan,2024-04-30 17:00:06-04:00,magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/30/magazine/jackfruit-taco-recipe.html,The New York Times
128,Less-Is-More Miso Roasted Salmon,"Eric Kim has just written a luminous essay about Japanese breakfast, with its constellation of small savory dishes (rice, miso soup, fish, pickles), and the daily practice of preparing it. You could make it bespoke every day, but the more pragmatic approach is to cook some of the elements ahead and fill out the meal with leftovers and other scraps from the fridge — “cooking for future you, not present you,” as Eric says, an idea I love and one you can embrace for any meal.His new breakfast recipe for miso roasted salmon can be borrowed for dinner — it’s as satisfying at 7 p.m. as it is at 7 a.m., beautifully and saltily simple. (Also borrow his recipe for spinach gomaae, with its light sesame dressing.) The salmon is below, along with four other dinners for the week ahead.Don’t have a subscription to New York Times Cooking?

129,"Getir, a Rapid Grocery-Delivery Service, Exits the U.S. and Europe","Getir, the rapid grocery-delivery company that boomed during Covid lockdowns, said it was ending its operations in the United States and Europe, a major retreat by another pandemic darling.The company, which aimed to deliver groceries and other small conveniences in as fast as 10 minutes, said it would refocus on its home base, Turkey. At its height, the privately held Getir was valued at nearly $12 billion after expanding quickly, buying up competitors and operating in nine countries.The company announced the decision in a short statement on Monday, adding that FreshDirect, its U.S. subsidiary, would continue operations.“Getir generates only 7 percent of its revenues from the markets it is exiting,” the statement said. “This decision will allow Getir to focus its financial resources on Turkey.”Getir was all about speed. Dressed in purple and yellow outfits, Getir’s workers zipped around on bikes in cities across Britain, Germany, the Netherlands and the United States, including New York and Chicago. The company’s expansion was fast: Until 2021, Getir operated only in Turkey. Within a year, it was in six European countries. Its valuation surged — to $11.8 billion in 2022 from less than $3 billion a year earlier.It snapped up rivals, such as the Spanish company Blok in mid-2021, just five months after Blok was founded. It also bought better-known brands such as Weezy in Britain and the German firm Gorillas. In 2021, Nazim Salur, a founder of Getir, said the company’s expansion was “a race against time” before competitors caught up.",By Eshe Nelson,2024-04-30 08:28:43-04:00,business,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/30/business/getir-grocery-delivery-europe-us.html,The New York Times
130,A Quick Fish Recipe That Covers All the Bases,"ImageCredit...Kerri Brewer for The New York Times. Food Stylist: Spencer Richards.Hello and “happy” Monday! I’m filling in for Melissa today, so it feels only right to kick things off with her new recipe for creamy fish with mushrooms and bacon.Pardon the Stefon-ism, but this recipe has it all: mild, white-fleshed fish (good for the fishy-fish averse); canned tomatoes (the pantry M.V.P.); mushrooms and bacon to add umami oomph; and crème fraîche (or heavy cream) to make everything a little lush. I’ll let Betsy, a reader, take it from here: “Y’all!!! This recipe slaps! So good! So easy! So delicious! Sauce is so creamy and amazing. Would be good on any/everything! Can’t wait to make this again!”Featured RecipeCreamy Fish With Mushrooms and BaconView Recipe →I once messed up a grocery delivery order, and what was supposed to be three jalapeños arrived as three big plastic clamshells of jalapeños. My instinct — and blanket solution — to “just throw it in the freezer” turned out to be a good one: The peppers froze well, and now I always have jalapeños on hand to chop as needed for recipes, like this new jalapeño-orange pork tenderloin with snap peas from Ali Slagle. I might also add some slices along with the vinegar, garlic and butter in Step 6 of Yasmin Fahr’s honey-garlic chicken; we are indeed a hot-honey house.There’s a group of recipes here at New York Times Cooking that I fondly call “Will it bean?” recipes. The answer is always yes: Buffalo beans, pizza beans, beans alla vodka, beans au vin. The newest and equally successful entry into this happy group is Carolina Gelen’s recipe for garlicky Alfredo beans, which are just what you think they are. Serve with soft breadsticks and a crunchy iceberg salad for exquisite Olive Garden vibes.Not beany, but also comforting and vegetarian: Kay Chun’s spring vegetable japchae, which tosses Korean glass (or sweet potato) noodles with all things colorful and crunchy. Since the noodles are wheat-free, this is a great dish for anyone avoiding gluten, and since the dish is delicious at room temperature, it’s a great option for anyone hoping to avoid a sad desk lunch.I’ll end with another mistake-turned-marvelous situation: I once misremembered the time I was meeting friends for dinner and arrived hours before our reservation. Already hungry, I ducked into a nearby Van Leeuwen for an affogato. It was kind of a brilliant move; the ice cream cured my hanger, and the espresso gave me the perkiness I needed to last through dinner (and laugh off my error). Could I have eaten a granola bar or baby carrots instead? Sure. But then I wouldn’t have had an affogato.Thanks for reading! Melissa is back with us on Wednesday, and I’ll see you on Thursday.Share full articleAdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTSite IndexSite Information Navigation© 2024 The New York Times CompanyNYTCoContact UsAccessibilityWork with usAdvertiseT Brand StudioYour Ad ChoicesPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleSite MapCanadaInternationalHelpSubscriptionsManage Privacy Preferences

131,A Taste of Now,"ImageCredit...Christopher Testani for The New York Times. Food Stylist: Simon Andrews.Good morning. I love the green I’m seeing at the tips of the hardwoods, the bright harlequin vibrancy of the alliums along the stream beds, the way the grass in the park is starting to thrive again after a long winter of abuse at the feet of dogs. Here’s spring garlic at the market, funky bouquets of ramps and, best of all, asparagus.Asparagus is always at the market, of course. There are no seasons in the supply chain of American food. Everything is grown somewhere all the time, and shipped to us by air and sea. But real asparagus, actual in-season local asparagus, grown somewhere within a couple hundred miles from home in warm spring sunlight and brought to you by rattletrap truck — that’s the best asparagus, a reminder of the passage of time and the promise of spring.I’m using mine for Melissa Clark’s new recipe for creamy asparagus pasta with peas and mint (above) — a taste of now. You could follow me this evening in making it, or steer into one of these other excellent recipes for asparagus that we’ve gathered for your pleasure. I hope you do.Featured RecipeCreamy Asparagus Pasta With Peas and MintView Recipe →With Sunday taken care of, we can look to the rest of the week. …MondayWe’re a long way from tomato season, but the cherry tomatoes at the market are still pretty good. (See above: hecho en Mexico.) I like them piled on Melissa’s recipe for a cherry tomato Caesar salad, with curls of shaved Parmesan and extra anchovies.

132,Your New Chocolate Chip Cookie Recipe,"ImageCredit...Kelly Marshall for The New York Times. Food Stylist: Samantha Seneviratne.I have never met Rick Martínez — I would love to, ideally with Choco in tow — but I consider him my cookie godfather. In 2017 he wrote about his favorite brown butter chocolate chip cookies for Bon Appétit; I made them and won third place in New York magazine’s staff holiday cookie contest that year. I’ve made the cookies a million times since, to the point that friends refer to them as “those cookies.” Rick does a lot of things well (like grilled chicken and brown butter glazed radishes and refried beans), but damn if that man doesn’t know a chocolate chip cookie.His new recipe for piloncillo chocolate chip cookies, then, deserves a red carpet rollout, blaring trumpets and ticker tape confetti. Grating the piloncillo (unrefined whole-cane sugar) is admittedly a bit of a chore, but the depth of flavor it adds to the cookies — notes of caramel, butterscotch, molasses, brown butter, even honeysuckle and anise — is well worth the elbow grease. It also adds texture, as the larger pieces of broken piloncillo render like bits of toffee inside the finished cookies. These are destined to be “those cookies.”Featured RecipePiloncillo Chocolate Chip CookiesView Recipe →Shifting from sweet to savory, David Tanis’s spring chicken with mushroom and lemon is a perfect excuse to go wild with all those fresh, leafy herbs at the market: dill, tarragon, parsley, chives and mint. Or go all in on your favorite (for me, that would be evergreen and ever-ready parsley). Leftover herbs can go into Melissa Clark’s all-purpose green sauce — which, incidentally, would be delicious on leftover chicken.Spring is also springing in this seared fish with creamed kale and leeks from Alexa Weibel, where the sautéed leeks do double duty, first infusing the cream that dresses the kale, and then mixing in with the rice to form a pale green pilaf.",By Mia Leimkuhler,2024-04-27 11:00:02-04:00,dining,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/27/dining/your-new-chocolate-chip-cookie-recipe.html,The New York Times
133,"Sesame Noodles, Buttered Biscuits, Charred Cabbage, Huevos Rancheros","ImageCredit...Ryan Liebe for The New York Times. Food Stylist: Simon Andrews.Good morning. There was a bald eagle flying up Shin Creek in the Beaverkill Valley, in the Catskill Mountains of New York. I was driving alongside her, on the roadbed above the stream. The eagle was looking for trout, as I would be later, she undoubtedly more successfully than me, and fair play to her for that. A bald eagle is an apex predator. I’m an amateur with a fake bug on the end of a 20-foot leader, waving a stick to send it in the direction of the fish whose head I saw rise on the edge of a riffle, near that stick that points sideways toward the rock — no, the other rock.It got me thinking about dinner. We had that in common, anyway, the bald eagle and me. For her, rainbow trout sashimi, no soy sauce. For me, spicy sesame noodles with chicken and peanuts (above), though with ground pork in place of the chicken and spaghetti in place of the fresh ramen noodles, because that’s what’s in the cupboard. It’s one of those dinners that comes together fast, with big flavor, and at the end of the week that’s generally what I’m looking for: easy preparation, with significant returns on a modest investment.Featured RecipeSpicy Sesame Noodles With Chicken and PeanutsView Recipe →And then: all-purpose biscuits in the morning, to split, butter and griddle. I’ll use those for midmorning egg sandwiches, with melted Cheddar and crisped bacon, ahead of a long drift on the river, or a short walk followed by a long nap.For dinner (if you take the buttering of those biscuits seriously, there’ll be no need for lunch), how about grilled lemongrass pork, with some rice vermicelli noodles, roasted peanuts, sliced cucumber, cilantro, mint and a lot of lime wedges?",By Sam Sifton,2024-04-26 11:00:03-04:00,dining,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/26/dining/sesame-noodles-buttered-biscuits-charred-cabbage-huevos-rancheros.html,The New York Times
134,"When U.S. Diplomats Visit China, Meal Choices Are About More Than Taste Buds","Leer en español阅读简体中文版閱讀繁體中文版Beijing beer made with American hops, to highlight the trade relationship between the two countries. Tibetan food, to send a human rights message. Mushrooms with possible hallucinogenic properties, just because they taste good.Where, what and how American dignitaries eat when they visit China is a serious matter. Choices of restaurants and dishes are rife with opportunities for geopolitical symbolism, as well as controversy and mockery. Chopstick skills — or a lack thereof — can be a sign of cultural competence or illiteracy.An exorbitantly expensive meal can make an official look out of touch. Too cheap or informal, and you risk appearing undignified. Authenticity, history, cooking technique and taste can all affect the perception of a meal choice.When Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken started a trip through China on Wednesday, part of the Biden administration’s efforts to stabilize the relationship between the two countries, some on Chinese social media wondered whether he would have time on his visit to Shanghai to stop and try some of the city’s famous xiaolongbao (soup dumplings).One recommendation that he do so came with something of a political warning: “Eating xiaolongbao is just like handling international relations,” a commentator wrote on Weibo. “If your attention slips even a little, you’ll burn your mouth.”Mr. Blinken did in fact visit a renowned soup dumpling restaurant that night. It’s unclear how much he considered the symbolism of his dumplings, but by indulging in a traditional popular snack, and by attending a basketball game, the optics suggested there was a more cordial spirit than on the trip he made last year, soon after a Chinese spy balloon drifting across the United States had heightened tensions.",By Yan Zhuang,2024-04-26 03:58:45-04:00,world,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/26/world/asia/us-china-visits-blinken-food.html,The New York Times
135,Three Gluten-Free Friendly Restaurants,"Last week I dedicated the newsletter to quickly answering seven reader questions, but some questions come up so frequently that they deserve a newsletter all their own. And by far, the query that has appeared in my inbox with the greatest frequency has been about gluten-free dining.More than 2 million Americans have been diagnosed with Celiac — though researchers estimate that far more people have the disease — and about one-third of Americans say they are trying to avoid or reduce gluten in their diets. I don’t fall into either category, but I can empathize with those who feel as if their dining options are severely limited by the ubiquity of gluten in, well, all of human existence.ImageModern Bread & Bagel specializes in gluten-free bagels and other baked goods.Credit...Emon Hassan for The New York TimesYou can come at this two ways. One, go to restaurants where gluten-free dining is the selling point — Senza Gluten in the West Village, Agata & Valentina and Noglu on the Upper East Side, Modern Bread & Bagel in Chelsea and the Upper West Side, and the Friedman’s chain of restaurants all come to mind. But that can be limiting, and the options often don’t live up to their gluten-full cousins. The second option, below, is to try a few restaurants I love with menus that aren’t filled with gluten land mines.Nami NoriOne reader was elated a few weeks ago when I spotlighted the sandos at Postcard Bakery in the West Village, which are served on gluten-free bread. But the gluten-freeness doesn’t end there: Postcard is a spinoff of Nami Nori, the temaki hand roll restaurant with locations in the West Village, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, and Montclair, N.J., which are also completely gluten-free restaurants, from the tempura misto starter all the way down to sesame miso chocolate chip cookies. The reason: Takahiro Sakaeda, a partner and chef at both restaurants, is gluten-intolerant.ImageBoth Nami Nori and Postcard Bakery are gluten-free because one of the restaurants’ chef-partners has Celiac disease.Credit...Sebastian Lucrecio",By Nikita Richardson,2024-04-25 16:00:14-04:00,dining,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/25/dining/three-gluten-free-friendly-restaurants.html,The New York Times
136,Now We’re (Barely) Cooking,"ImageCredit...Kelly Marshall for The New York Times. Food Stylist: Samantha Seneviratne.After rhapsodizing about the joys of hosting last week, I walked the walk and threw an elaborate dinner party on Sunday. It was a truly delightful way to spend the weekend, but I’ll say this: After all of the shopping and the prepping and the being on my feet for 12 consecutive hours, I don’t very much want to cook at all right now. I contain multitudes.So I’m letting the pendulum swing squarely into capital-E easy territory over the next few days, sticking to the kind of cooking that makes you question whether you can even really call it cooking. And as the days continue to ascend in daylight and in warmth, I’m trying to spend even less of my weeknight evenings in the kitchen: I want a quick dinner and a leisurely sunset walk after work.In practice, that’s looking a lot like Sarah DiGregorio’s 30-minute one-pot miso-mascarpone pasta (above) with Ali Slagle’s 30-minute roasted spring vegetables (scallions! asparagus! green beans!) going in the oven at the same time if I feel like multitasking, or a heaping handful of frozen peas going straight into the pasta pot if I don’t. Neither of those recipes calls for more than six ingredients.One-Pot Miso-Mascarpone PastaView this recipe.Eric Kim’s been on the supremely easy sheet-pan cooking beat as of late, and I’m eternally grateful for it. I have his 30-minute sheet-pan japchae on standby for the day my body cries out for a tangled heap of vegetables, and his sheet-pan quesadillas at the ready for the day(s) I want little more than a vehicle for crispy, melty cheese.",By Tanya Sichynsky,2024-04-25 13:00:02-04:00,dining,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/25/dining/now-were-barely-cooking.html,The New York Times
137,All In on Aloo Chicken,"ImageCredit...Christopher Testani for The New York Times. Food Stylist: Cyd Raftus McDowell.Do you ever see a recipe and know immediately that, yes, you’re going to make that? You don’t bother checking what the ingredients are or how long it will take or who created it — you just know that you need to eat that dish. That’s how I felt about this aloo chicken.Of course, I did check on all of those other things. The ingredients are a mix of kitchen staples (onion, ginger, garlic, spices) and easy grocery store grabs (boneless, skinless chicken thighs, some Roma tomatoes and Yukon Gold potatoes). About half of the cooking time is spent on gentle sautéing, while the other half is hands-off simmering. And the recipe is by Zainab Shah, the genius behind these sheet-pan fish tikka, mattar paneer and one-pot vegetable biryani recipes, all New York Times Cooking hits. In sum: I want this aloo chicken, and I want it now.Featured RecipeAloo ChickenView Recipe →I have a similar “gimme gimme” reaction to the word “croutons,” so of course I sat up straight when I clocked Ali Slagle’s recipe for sheet-pan sausages and mushrooms with arugula and croutons. The promise of hot Italian sausages and Zuni Café-esque croutons in a red wine vinaigrette was enough to hook me, but this note from Ali sealed the deal: “If stuffed mushrooms grew up into a main course, it would be this one-pan dinner.” Done, and added to my recipe box. Next!“Hetty Lui McKinnon” is shorthand for “excellent vegetarian recipes” in my mind; her tom yum soup with tofu and vermicelli is a fine example. It’s wildly flavorful: sour from the lime juice, spicy from the ginger and sambal oelek, verdantly citrusy from the lemongrass and rounded out with silken tofu and optional evaporated (or coconut) milk. Several readers tucked shredded roast or rotisserie chicken into their soup, an excellent idea for adding a bit of heft.For every new recipe that catches my eye, there’s an old standby that, if it were in a cookbook, would be stained and scribbled with notes. Mark Bittman’s salmon roasted in butter comes to mind, a five-star go-to with over 8,500 reviews. I also return to Rick Martínez’s chilaquiles often for leisurely breakfasts and thrifty dinners. (Using Rick’s tips in the recipe, I bake instead of fry my stale tortillas, but you do you!) To borrow a Sam Siftonism, that salsa guajillo would taste good on a shoe.And speaking of breakfast for dinner: Here is Martha Rose Shulman’s blueberry coconut oatmeal pudding. Granted, it’s probably better as a dessert than a dinner, but I’d absolutely dive into a bowl of this after work, maybe with a hefty scrape of nut butter, definitely on the couch in my sweats.Share full articleAdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTSite IndexSite Information Navigation© 2024 The New York Times CompanyNYTCoContact UsAccessibilityWork with usAdvertiseT Brand StudioYour Ad ChoicesPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleSite MapCanadaInternationalHelpSubscriptionsManage Privacy Preferences

The 8,000-square-foot space is laid out like a well-appointed home: Guests enter through the library and can wander the great room, bedroom, dining room, kitchen, bar and lounge at their leisure. Everything within — furniture, lighting, art and even the pantry provisions — is available for purchase. Ozemba and Hung collaborated with several of their creative friends on the objects and décor that fill the space. They designed the tiling throughout with the New York City-based artist Shane Gabier, while a fresco depicting eels with earrings by the painter Claudio Bonuglia adorns a portion of the bar and lounge, which will open for evening service beginning this summer. The furniture on display is a mix of restored vintage pieces and new designs by Ozemba and Hung, some of which can be customized with imagery drawn up by various tattoo artists. “We’ll be able to sit down with people and play,” Ozemba says of the space’s potential to spur conversation and inspire new projects. “Retail shouldn’t be so serious.

In a new exhibit at Pace Gallery in Manhattan’s Chelsea neighborhood entitled “Stratagems,” Donovan presents 11 towering new works constructed entirely from CDs, most of which she scavenged and salvaged from eBay. “We live in an age that feels increasingly defined by cycles of ingenuity and obsolescence,” says Donovan. “The archives of human experience have moved from paper volumes to clouds just during my lifetime, and the CD is probably the last vestige of our understanding of data as an object.” She left the discs intact, strategically overlapping and adhering them one another, resulting in structures that get up to nine feet tall. They’re meant to allude to the architecture of skyscrapers, an echo that’s visible from the windows of the seventh floor where the show is mounted. On a sunny day, Donovan’s towers sometimes have a prismatic effect, throwing rainbows of light onto the floor. On May 4, during Frieze Week in New York, Donovan’s friend the choreographer Kim Brandt will stage a performance with six dancers within the exhibition. “Stratagems” is on view from May 3 through June 15, pacegallery.com.Eat HereA New Batch of Bakeries in GreenpointImageLeft: a range of sweet and savory pastries at Radio Bakery, one of several new bakeries that have recently opened in Brooklyn’s Greenpoint neighborhood. Right: a tzatziki escargot pastry at Paloma Bakery.Credit...Left: courtesy of Radio Bakery. Right: courtesy of Paloma BakeryBy Maria GeymanGreenpoint, Brooklyn’s northernmost neighborhood, has long been a destination for bakeries in New York City. There’s the decades-old Polish standby Peter Pan, which was immortalized as the part-time workplace of Zendaya’s MJ in “Spider-Man: No Way Home” (2021), and Syrena bakery, another Polish staple since 1993 selling everything from bread and babka to tiramisù and holiday cookies. Several more purveyors of baked goods have opened in the past year, including Radio Bakery, led by the pastry chef Kelly Mencin with a menu that focuses on New York “flavor memories,” as she puts it, like bacon, egg and cheese focaccia, scallion sesame twists and Earl Grey morning buns. In November, Taku Sando opened on Greenpoint Avenue, making decadent Japanese sandwiches served on homemade shokupan bread that’s also sold by the loaf. In a cinder red building on Norman Avenue, there’s Pan Pan Vino Vino, a bakery and wine bar from the owners of Nura, an Indian-inspired restaurant a few blocks away. The designer and co-owner Nico Arze has adorned the pastry case with volcano paintings in a nod to his native Chile. Within it, there are loaves of caraway rye bread — the pastry chef Sam Short remembers her Polish grandmother making liverwurst sandwiches with it — alongside guava cream cheese Danishes made from croissant trimmings. And as of February, the sea of coffee cups and pastry-laden bags at McGolrick Park has taken on a white and red hue — Paloma Coffee’s signature colors — since the roaster opened a bakery outpost on Nassau Avenue. Its single-origin beans are now complemented by innovative pastries (get the artichoke, olive and potato bear claw).",By Roxanne Fequiere,2024-04-25 09:00:08-04:00,t-magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/25/t-magazine/bakeries-greenpoint-brooklyn.html,The New York Times
139,36 Hours on Maui," Maui is the Goldilocks island: It is neither too big nor too small, and for its three million annual visitors, its perfect year-round temperature, rainbow-splashed volcanic summits and sugary beaches are just right. But last August, Maui’s equilibrium met disaster. Catastrophic wildfires reduced the historic town of Lahaina to ash, claiming more than 100 lives. Conflicting messages urged visitors to stay away and let the island heal, but also to come and help sustain the economy. Eight months later, the message is more unified that Maui is ready to greet tourists again. Housing remains a critical need for displaced residents. Lahaina will take years to rebuild. But Maui’s inherent beauty and hospitality remain as vibrant as ever. It’s a great time to explore Central and South Maui, where new cocktail bars, outrigger canoe tours and Indigenous art exhibits reveal the community’s creativity and resilience.  RecommendationsKey stops The 10,000-foot summit of Haleakalā National Park (pronounced with an emphasis on “la”) has a view of the rising sun, volcanic vistas and some of the planet’s rarest plants and birds.The Hale Hō‘ike‘ike museum showcases Hawaiian artwork, carved deities and a redwood plank surfboard owned by the legendary swimmer and surfer Duke Kahanamoku.Balai Pata is a new restaurant that celebrates Filipino flavors with savory soups, desserts big enough for two and monthly karaoke nights. Attractions and outdoor activities The Wailea Beach Path meanders along South Maui’s photogenic coast between posh resorts and the deep blue Pacific.The hiking trails at ‘Īao Valley State Monument (pronounced EE-ow) penetrate the lush West Maui Mountains, winding past waterfalls and taro patches.Enormous murals by Small Town Big Art, a public art project, in colorful and historic Wailuku town, are worth taking a stroll to see, and they’re navigable by an online map.Blue Water Rafting’s exhilarating tours of the Kanaio Coast explore hidden coves, sea caves and charismatic marine life.Ho‘okipa Beach Park, one of the world’s top surf spots, is also a great place to spy on napping sea turtles. Restaurants and bars Oao Sushi Bar & Grill offers beautifully prepared Japanese fare, such as inventive sushi rolls and purple-yam pot de crème, in a Wailea shopping center.Tikehau Lounge serves seasonal craft cocktails made with local spirits and garnished with tiny katana swords and surfboards.Kaohu Store is a mom-and-pop grocery that produces the island’s best poke, raw fish mixed with traditional seasonings such as ground kukui nuts and seaweed.Tails Up Maui, a partnership between a local chef and a fisherman, serves excellent fish sandwiches and chicken plates.Wailuku Coffee Co. is the place to stop for Maui-grown coffee or espresso while exploring Wailuku.Esters Fair Prospect, a charming tropical bar on Wailuku’s Main Street, serves daiquiris made with a choice of three dozen rums and appetizers featuring fresh marlin.Mama’s Fish House, a celebrated restaurant on a secluded lagoon, lists the names of the fishermen who caught the snapper and octopus on its menu. Shopping On Saturday mornings, the Upcountry Farmers Market is a miniature street fair with live music and vendors offering a bounty of Maui-grown produce and prepared foods.‘Oko‘a Farm Store sells a cornucopia of organic tropical fruits and vegetables in fresh, dried and powdered form.T. Komoda Store and Bakery, which has served the Maui community for more than a century, sells out of its cream puffs and butter rolls daily.Sabado Art Gallery is where the local artist Philip Sabado paints, teaches workshops and sells his color-saturated impressions of Maui landscapes and hula dancers.Native Intelligence offers a wealth of Hawaiian art and fashion: Locals come here for Aloha shirts and sarongs, fine jewelry and fresh flower leis. Where to stay Four Seasons Resort Maui sets the standard for service with poolside spritzes, immaculate housekeeping and a terrific complimentary kids’ camp. Guests can book spa treatments in oceanfront huts and outrigger canoe excursions that launch from the resort’s adjoining beach. Rooms start at $1,095 a night.Hotel Wailea is an adults-only boutique hotel on a hill overlooking South Maui. While not directly on the beach, it’s only a short shuttle ride away. Elegant suites are spacious (750 square feet with kitchenettes) and the Birdcage lounge is a prime spot for toasting the sunset. Rooms start at $799.Maui Kamaole is a condo complex across the street from Kama‘ole Beach Park III, between Wailea and Kihei on Maui’s south shore. One- and two-bedroom units feature full kitchens, laundry facilities and lush landscaping. Rooms start at $500.Since the recent fire intensified the housing shortage, visitors should avoid short-term rentals in residential areas. Instead, book hotels that offer in-room kitchens, such as Fairmont Kea Lani or Mana Kai Maui. Getting around The best way to explore the island is by car. The major rental companies each have kiosks at Kahului Airport. Taxis and ride-hailing services are available, but long distances between destinations make this an expensive option. Maui’s public transit is limited. The Maui Bus operates 12 routes, including two that stop at the airport. One-way fares cost $2; day passes are $4.  ItineraryFriday   Wailea Beach Path   5:30 p.m. Catch the setting sun on a coastal walk The Wailea Beach Path, which meanders along the island’s southern coast, reflects Maui’s almost contradictory personas: On one side, opulent resorts flaunt swim-up bars and nightly torch-lighting ceremonies. A subtler drama unfolds on the opposite side, where native flora like honey-scented naio bushes, spiky hala trees and hibiscus blossoms flourish along the rocky shoreline. Sit and listen to the sea rush through the lava rocks as the sun drops between three islands: Lanai, Kahoolawe and tiny Molokini. In the 1970s, nine Native Hawaiians occupied Kahoolawe in defiance of the U.S. military, which had been using the island as a bombing range for decades. Their daring protest sparked what is now known as the Hawaiian Renaissance — a revival of Indigenous culture that continues today.    Wailea Beach Path   6:30 p.m. Try beautiful sushi and a bright purple dessert Head to Oao Sushi Bar & Grill in the Wailea area for beautifully prepared Japanese fare. The owner and head chef, J.R. Oao, sharpened his knife at Maui’s best sushi bars (including a stint at Nobu Lana‘i) before opening his first brick-and-mortar restaurant last year (he also has a food truck in Kihei, a few miles north). His signature rolls are balanced and inventive: Try the baked California roll ($22), served hot and loaded with shrimp and scallops. Juicy seared lamb chops rest on a smear of umami-rich red miso ($42). Even the salads impress — bright cilantro vinaigrette with a hint of horseradish enlivens a simple mix of Maui-grown greens, roasted corn and goat cheese ($16). For dessert, the ube pot de crème ($14), made from purple yam, is luscious, light and almost cartoonishly bright.       8:30 p.m. Sample local spirits The name of Tikehau, a new lounge in Wailea, means “peaceful landing.” The bar, which opened in November and is quietly raising the standard for craft cocktails statewide, was true to its name for Mari Howe, its manager, and other staff who came to work here after losing jobs or homes to the Lahaina fire. Everything is thoughtfully selected, from the gold-leaf wallpaper to the crystal stemware. Garnishes are coveted souvenirs; a tiny surfboard floats atop the Thousand Peaks ($19) — a lagoon-blue Paloma topped with jasmine-tea “sea foam.” The Hawaiian Samurai ($50), a top-shelf-whiskey libation, comes with a miniature katana sword. Ms. Howe’s seasonal menu incorporates local spirits and mixers: fresh pineapple juice, Kō Hana rum and okolehao, a moonshine made from Hawaiian ti plants. Upscale snacks include poisson cru, a raw-fish dish ($25), and smoked taro hummus ($15).         Explore the rugged Kanaio Coast’s hidden coves and sea caves with a rafting tour.  Saturday      4 a.m. Greet the day from atop a volcano This morning mission requires preparation. First, book a sunrise reservation at Haleakalā National Park well in advance ($1 permit, $30 park entrance). Then pack really warm clothes. In the darkness, drive slowly up the 10,000-foot volcano; fog often obscures cattle and native geese loitering in hairpin turns. Your efforts will be rewarded at the peak — first by the velvet sky awash with stars, then by the sun’s rays spilling across the fire-forged mountain. Notice how the silverswords (hedgehog-like plants that grow only here) sparkle in the golden light. As you descend, stop at Hosmer Grove, where a short hike leads to a forest full of Hawaiian honeycreepers, birds that are among some of the planet’s rarest.       9 a.m. Buy local at a farmers’ market Midway down Haleakalā, stop at the Upcountry Farmers Market. Every Saturday morning, the Kulamalu Town Center parking lot turns into a miniature street fair with live music and vendors offering a dizzying array of Maui-grown produce and prepared foods. You’ll find things to eat immediately — fresh coconut, vegan sweet-potato cheesecake and Venezuelan arepas — as well as things to stash in your suitcase, like passion-fruit butter and macadamia nuts. Don’t miss the ‘Oko‘a Farm Store, which migrated from the market into an adjacent storefront. The store’s 46-acre farm supplies a cornucopia of tropical fruits and vegetables; its shelves teem with jars of pickled, powdered, and freeze-dried treats and tonics.    Baldwin Avenue   10 a.m. Drive through Maui’s plantation past Take the scenic drive back to sea level through historic Makawao and Paia towns. Bordered by a rodeo arena and a polo field, Makawao is the charming headquarters of the paniolo, Hawaiian cowboys who continue to rope and ride across the island’s lush ranchlands. On the corner of Makawao and Baldwin Avenues you’ll see T. Komoda Store and Bakery; this beloved family-run business, which has served the community since 1916, sells out of its cream puffs and butter rolls daily. Follow Baldwin past the defunct sugar mill to Paia. Once a busy sugar plantation hub surrounded by green cane fields, it’s now home to surfers and artists. As you pass Baldwin Beach, admire the view of the rain-carved West Maui Mountains. The morning light often reveals the hidden interior of ‘Īao Valley, your next destination.    Baldwin Avenue    Wailuku River   11 a.m. Picnic by a waterfall Head to Kaohu Store in Wailuku for lunch to go. This mom-and-pop grocery offers the island’s best poke — raw fish mixed with traditional seasonings such as ground kukui nuts and seaweed (from $18 a pound). Add two scoops of rice and crunchy fern salad for a truly local meal. If you prefer a cooked lunch, visit Tails Up Maui for a classy fish sandwich ($19) or mochiko (rice flour) fried chicken ($17). Take your picnic to Kepaniwai Park, where model houses commemorate the diverse cultures of Hawaii’s sugar plantation era, and dip your feet into the Wailuku River. Continue to ‘Īao Valley State Monument (out-of-state visitors need reservations; $5 entrance fee, $10 parking). Paved walkways wind through a traditional lo‘i kalo (taro patch), past multiple waterfalls and up to a stunning lookout.    Wailuku River   2 p.m. See Hawaiian artifacts and check out colorful murals Peruse the art and artifacts at Hale Hō‘ike‘ike, a captivating repository of Hawaiian culture in the former home of the missionary-artist Edward Bailey. Exhibits showcase Hawaiian feather work and quilts, carved deities, and paintings depicting 19th-century Maui. Imagine trying to paddle the legendary swimmer and surfer Duke Kahanamoku’s redwood plank surfboard into the waves (entry, $10). From there, stroll through Wailuku, Maui’s somewhat sleepy seat of local government. Narrow side streets yield many treasures: See enormous street murals (use the online map by Small Town Big Art, a public art project), admire the color-saturated paintings at Sabado Art Gallery and find refreshment at Wailuku Coffee Co. or Esters Fair Prospect, a cocktail bar. After shopping for Hawaiian books and clothing at Native Intelligence, buy yourself a fragrant flower lei to wear for the duration of your trip.       6 p.m. Enjoy a Filipino feast At Balai Pata, a new Filipino restaurant in Kahului, a celebration of the flavors that the chef and owner Joey Macadangdang grew up with is a welcome addition to Maui’s restaurant scene. Plump Kauai prawns sauteed in garlicky fish sauce ($17) set the stage for savory sinigang ($30) — tamarind broth loaded with long beans, okra and fish. For dessert, two can share the halo-halo ($18) — crushed ice topped with avocado, ube ice cream, coconut cream and fruit jellies, served in a coconut shell. The décor reflects a bright, homespun aesthetic, and once a month, local families fill the restaurant for late-night happy hour and karaoke battles — check Instagram for dates.         Jumping into a pool in Kepaniwai Park.  Sunday   Blue Water Rafting   6:30 a.m. Explore the rugged Kanaio Coast A trip to Maui isn’t complete without ducking underwater to spy on clouds of striped manini fish, eagle rays and turtles. While most snorkel tours start at Mā‘alaea Harbor, Blue Water Rafting boards at the Kihei boat ramp — offering easier access and one of the only tours of Kanaio Coast’s hidden coves and sea caves ($179, four hours). Climb into the rigid-hulled raft beside two dozen other passengers (fewer than the big tour boats) and watch for dolphins. In winter, close encounters with whales are common. As you peer into the pristine bay formed by Maui’s youngest lava flow, imagine the Polynesian wayfinders sailing here centuries ago, followed by the French explorer La Pérouse in 1786. The ride is exhilarating but bumpy.    Blue Water Rafting   12 p.m. Indulge in a fresh fish lunch at Mama’s Don’t be shy: Wear your flower lei to lunch at Mama’s Fish House. Old-style hospitality reigns at this celebrated restaurant on a sheltered lagoon. Servers greet you in vintage Aloha wear and offer complimentary bowls of poi (pounded taro — a staple of the traditional Hawaiian diet). The menu is pricey but worthy; long before it was fashionable, Mama’s listed who caught each fish and where. A recent menu featured sea bass hooked by Ivan Ventura in Hana ($68). If you ordered only dessert, you’d still leave happy; the Polynesian Black Pearl ($24) is an edible version of “The Birth of Venus”: chocolate mousse and passion fruit ensconced in a cookie seashell. Tables can book up a year out. After lunch, drive two minutes east to Ho‘okipa Beach Park, where surfers carve waves and sea turtles bask on the sand.

140,The Mixed Martial Artist Who Became the King of Tidy Eating,"Keith Lee is sitting in the passenger seat of a car outside Juanderful Tacos in Phoenix. “I’m going to show you everything we got, and we’re going to try it and rate it 1 through 10,” he announces to his 16.1 million TikTok followers, his hands brought together in a steeple. He presents four partly unwrapped tacos for viewers’ consideration: pollo, carne asada, cabeza and a pollo quesataco. He attacks the quesataco first, sprinkling a pinch of chopped onion and cilantro over its innards, topping everything off with salsa verde and a squeeze of lime. He displays the taco’s cross-section for the camera, then carefully introduces one end of the oozing canoe — a mass of meat, cheese and salsa already lugeing toward the limits of its enclosure — into his mouth.The bite is comprehensive. Every ingredient makes it in. It is also clean: There is no residue left around Lee’s lips. A few seconds of moistly entranced chewing follow before Lee brings his nontaco hand to his mouth and announces — from behind a guard of fingers laced with a single streak of green sauce — “It’s so fresh, crisp, seasoned: 8.7 out of 10. I need about six of these though, I ain’t gonna lie to you. Six or seven.”He is comfortably one of the cleanest professional eaters at work today.Lee proceeds to eat the three remaining tacos, pausing only to rave about their quality. But each time he does so, it’s from behind one hand, which is always politely shielding his mouth. He even apologizes for the watery fleck of salsa still trailing across his fingers: “Excuse my hands. I got messy.”In the comments, Lee’s followers try to prepare Juanderful Tacos for the torrent of business that restaurants face once they’ve received a Keith Lee tick of approval. (“Get ready tomorrow!”) Among the growing ranks of online food influencers — all the professional and semiprofessional eaters jawing straight into the camera on TikTok, YouTube and Instagram — few are bigger or more influential than Lee. He turned to food reviewing as his first career, in mixed martial arts, was coming to an end, and in the short time since, he’s amassed not only millions of followers but also the power to change restaurants’ fortunes and provoke hysterical debate in some of the cities he visits. He’s admired for the attention he pays to small, independent businesses; for his closeness to his family, which accompanies him on cross-country food tours; for his appreciation of good service and generosity with tips.Yet there’s been little discussion of his uniquely dainty eating style, which is a key element of his aesthetic and a leading source, I believe, of his success.",By Aaron Timms,2024-04-25 05:04:46-04:00,magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/25/magazine/keith-lee-food-review-tiktok.html,The New York Times
141,"With New Salt and Sugar Limits, School Cafeterias Are ‘Cringing’","Around 11:40 on a cool spring day in early April, students began to stream into the lunchroom at Haleyville High School in Alabama.Cheerleaders, soccer and baseball players, and other members of the student body filed through the lunch line and sat at their tables. They chatted and laughed about upcoming games (go, Roaring Lions!) and prom as they dug into plates of chicken Alfredo, green beans and salad.Emma Anne Hallman, standing in a corner, watched the teenagers carefully. As the child nutrition director for the Haleyville City School District, she has the job of feeding 1,600 students, in prekindergarten through 12th grade.ImageEmma Anne Hallman, the nutrition director for the Haleyville School District, said the proposed food regulations “could result in changes across our menus.”For months, Ms. Hallman and other heads of school lunch programs have worried about new federal regulations that would reduce allowable sodium levels and introduce new sugar restrictions for foods served in school cafeterias. A debate has raged, with many parents and nutritionists applauding efforts to make lunches more nutritious while some school lunch administrators fretted that the results will be less tasty to students, reducing consumption and increasing waste.“We are cringing, as it could result in changes across our menus,” Ms. Hallman said. “We would have to look at the sodium amounts in the recipes of some of our students’ favorite foods, like chicken wings, hot wings or even some of the Asian foods.”",By Julie Creswell and Audra Melton,2024-04-25 05:04:02-04:00,business,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/25/business/school-lunches-salt-sugar-regulations.html,The New York Times
142,Google Employees Tune Out Antitrust Threat as Trial Comes to a Head,"On Tuesday, Google’s employees gathered for an all-hands meeting named T.G.I.F. These companywide meetings are rarely held on Fridays these days, but the name has stuck.Executives shared highlights from a recent earnings report and cloud-computing conference, and warned workers against taking disruptive actions in the wake of internal protests against a cloud-computing contract with Israel.But no one in the meeting, two employees said, broached a topic that could have a dramatic impact on Google: its landmark antitrust trial with the Justice Department, where arguments are finally coming to an end this week.For eight months, while tech policy experts have tried to divine what a Google victory or loss would mean for the power of tech giants in the United States, Google’s employees have mostly ignored the antitrust fight, according to interviews with a dozen current and recent workers, who asked not to be identified because they were not authorized to discuss the legal matter.Even among Google’s outspoken employees, the legal risks facing the company have become background noise. For two decades the company has been one of Silicon Valley’s apex predators, and its workers have grown accustomed to Google’s breezing past regulatory scrutiny. Why expect something different this time?Besides, they added, the more pressing threat to Google is a competitive one posed by Microsoft and OpenAI, the maker of the ChatGPT chatbot. (The New York Times sued OpenAI and Microsoft in December for copyright infringement of news content related to A.I. systems.)",By Nico Grant,2024-05-03 05:04:42-04:00,technology,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/03/technology/google-employees-antitrust-trial.html,The New York Times
143,U.S. Antitrust Case Against Google Is Just the Start,"The U.S. government’s landmark antitrust trial against Google’s search business is nearing its conclusion. But the parade of major federal cases challenging Big Tech’s power is just getting going.Under the Trump administration, the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission started investigating Amazon, Apple, Google and Meta, the parent company of Instagram and WhatsApp, for monopolistic behavior. The government has since sued all four companies — Google twice — in what it says is an effort to rein in their power and promote more competition.The companies have denied the claims and are fighting back.Closing arguments wrap up on Friday in Google’s first antitrust suit on allegations that it has a monopoly in internet search. The judge’s ruling, expected in the coming weeks or months, is likely to set precedents for the remaining cases.Here’s the latest on the state of the U.S. government v. Big Tech.AmazonIn September, the F.T.C. and 17 states sued Amazon, accusing it of protecting a monopoly by squeezing sellers on its vast marketplace and favoring its own services. The practices also harmed consumers, the F.T.C. argued, and resulted in some cases of “artificially higher prices” because Amazon prevented those selling goods on its site from offering the same products on other online sites for less.A judge in U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington set the beginning of the trial for October 2026.Amazon has asked the judge to dismiss the case and has argued that it often offers low prices to consumers and doesn’t hurt sellers on its marketplace. The lawsuit shows a “fundamental misunderstanding of retail,” the company has argued.",By Cecilia Kang and David McCabe,2024-05-03 05:06:18-04:00,technology,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/03/technology/google-apple-amazon-meta-antitrust.html,The New York Times
144,Apple Reports Decline in Sales and Profit Amid iPhone Struggles in China,"Difficulties have been piling up for Apple. In recent months, it has been sued by the Justice Department, fined by European regulators and challenged by the resurgence of a Chinese smartphone competitor.On Thursday, the company added to its list of problems, reporting that its business was in a slump.Apple said sales fell 4 percent to $90.8 billion for the three months that ended in March. Revenue from iPhones, iPads and wearables like the Apple Watch declined from the same quarter last year, while sales of software and services rose. Profit fell 2 percent to $23.64 billion, Apple’s first quarterly decline in a year.Apple’s struggles were most worrisome in China, the world’s second-largest smartphone market, where sales fell 8 percent. The iPhone’s popularity there has waned since Huawei, which the Trump administration restricted from working with U.S. technology firms, introduced a new smartphone with 5G abilities last year. Last quarter, Apple’s share of smartphones sold in China fell 4 percent, according to Counterpoint, a technology research firm.Shares of Apple rose 6.5 percent because the results slightly exceeded Wall Street predictions for quarterly sales and profit and were better in China than feared. The company said that it would repurchase $110 billion of stock and that its sales were on track to increase in the current quarter.The poor results stood in contrast to the strong performances of other big tech companies. Over the past two weeks, Amazon reported that its quarterly profits had tripled, Microsoft increased quarterly sales from cloud computing by a third and Alphabet, Google’s parent company, announced that it would pay its first dividend.Those companies’ sales have accelerated in part because of their investments in generative artificial intelligence. The technology, which can write essays and software code, is one that Apple hasn’t yet incorporated into its products. Investors hope that will change in June when Apple holds its annual developers’ conference and reveals its newest software.",By Tripp Mickle,2024-05-02 17:04:45-04:00,technology,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/02/technology/apple-earnings-china.html,The New York Times
145,"Final Arguments in Google Antitrust Trial Conclude, Setting Up Landmark Ruling","A landmark antitrust trial against Google concluded on Friday after a federal judge heard final arguments, setting the stage for a ruling that could fundamentally shift the tech industry’s power.“The importance and significance of this case is not lost on me, not only for Google but for the public,” Judge Amit P. Mehta said in the final moments of the proceedings on Friday. He thanked the lawyers who argued the case, and then added, “I guess you’ve passed the baton to us.”Now, he must decide the case in which the Justice Department and state attorneys general say that Google has abused a monopoly over the search business, stifling competitors and limiting innovation, something the company denies.During two days of closing arguments, Judge Mehta of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia did not reveal how he planned to rule. He grilled both sides, frequently referencing testimony and evidence from the 10-week trial last year to poke holes in their arguments. He also demanded that they explain how their positions fit with major legal precedents.As the proceedings closed on Friday, Kenneth Dintzer, the Justice Department’s lead trial lawyer, argued that if antitrust laws “cannot thaw” a search business dominated by Google, the company’s practices will continue into the future.John E. Schmidtlein, Google’s lead lawyer, countered that a ruling in favor of the government “would be an unprecedented decision to punish a company for winning on the merits.”",By David McCabe and Cecilia Kang,2024-05-03 18:11:10-04:00,technology,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/03/technology/google-antitrust-trial.html,The New York Times
146,TikTok’s Boss Goes From Reserved Tech Exec to Met Gala Chair,"Although the Met Gala serves as a branding event for Vogue, it has long accepted sponsorships from the tech giants that have threatened the very survival of legacy media publications.Jeff Bezos, the Amazon founder, appeared as the ball’s honorary chair in 2012. Four years later, when Apple was a Met Gala sponsor, its chief executive, Tim Cook, showed up in tux and tails. And Instagram supplied cash in 2022.The 2024 event is sponsored, in part, by TikTok, the social media goliath whose future looks murkier than that of Condé Nast, the publisher of Vogue, The New Yorker and other magazines, which has laid off employees and shuttered or sold off some of its publications in recent years.TikTok found itself in jeopardy last month, when President Biden signed a bill that gave ByteDance, the Chinese company that owns TikTok, nine months to sell off the app or face a ban in the United States. In the wake of that political firestorm, Shou Chew, the 41-year-old chief executive of TikTok, is expected to join dozens of celebrity guests at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in Manhattan on Monday evening.He was selected by Anna Wintour as an honorary chair for the benefit, which raises tens of millions of dollars each year for the museum’s Costume Institute. Ms. Wintour, the global editorial director of Condé Nast and the editor in chief of Vogue, has run the event for a quarter of a century, using her sense of celebrity and fashion synergy to create a splashy showcase of some of the world’s most influential people, a group that has come to include more social media influencers and fewer one-name stars (Beyoncé, Lady Gaga, Madonna) in recent years.TikTok may be loathed by Washington lawmakers who have raised concerns about the Chinese government’s access to its 170 millions users in the United States, but it remains an undeniable cultural force in American life, especially among Gen Z. The app is also a fashion force, and the Met Gala provides many TikTok creators with plenty of fodder. That makes the little-known Mr. Chew at least as powerful as the much more recognizable co-chairs of this year’s party — Zendaya, Jennifer Lopez, Bad Bunny, Chris Hemsworth and Ms. Wintour herself.","By Jacob Bernstein, Madison Malone Kircher and Sapna Maheshwari",2024-05-03 13:00:49-04:00,style,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/03/style/met-gala-shou-chew-tiktok.html,The New York Times

148,Judge Grills U.S. and Google on Antitrust Claims,"The judge overseeing a landmark U.S. antitrust challenge to Google tried to poke holes in both sides’ cases during closing arguments Thursday as he weighed a ruling that could reshape the technology industry.Judge Amit P. Mehta was presiding over the first day of closing arguments in the most consequential tech antitrust case since the U.S. government sued Microsoft in the late 1990s. The Justice Department has sued Google, accusing it of illegally shoring up a monopoly in online search. Google has denied the claims.On Thursday, Judge Mehta questioned the government’s argument that Google’s dominance had hurt the quality of the experience for searching for information online. But he also pushed Google to defend its central argument that it isn’t a monopoly because consumers use other companies like Amazon to search for shopping items and TikTok to search for music clips.“Certainly I don’t think the average person would say, ‘Google and Amazon are the same thing,’” Judge Mehta said.His ruling — expected in the coming weeks or months — will help set a precedent for a series of government challenges to tech giants’ size and power. Federal regulators have also filed antitrust lawsuits against Apple, Amazon and Meta, and a second case against Google over online advertising.Before the start of closing arguments in a U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia courtroom, Jonathan Kanter, head of the Justice Department’s antitrust division, approached Kent Walker, president of global affairs at Google, to chat.",By David McCabe and Cecilia Kang,2024-05-02 13:21:21-04:00,technology,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/02/technology/judge-mehta-google-antitrust-closing-arguments.html,The New York Times
149,Strongest U.S. Challenge to Big Tech’s Power Nears Climax in Google Trial,"The biggest U.S. challenge so far to the vast power of today’s tech giants is nearing its conclusion.Starting Thursday, lawyers for the Justice Department, state attorneys general and Google delivered their final arguments in a yearslong case — U.S. et al. v. Google — over whether the tech giant broke federal antitrust laws to maintain its online search dominance. Arguments are scheduled to conclude Friday.The government claims that Google competed unfairly when it paid Apple and other companies billions of dollars to automatically handle searches on smartphones and web browsers. Google insists that consumers use its search engine because it is the best product.In the coming weeks or months, the judge who has overseen the trial in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, Amit P. Mehta, will deliver a ruling that could change the way Google does business or even break up the company — or absolve the tech giant completely. Many antitrust experts expect he will land somewhere in the middle, ruling only some of Google’s tactics out of bounds.The trial is the biggest challenge to date to the vast power of today’s tech giants, which have defined an era when billions of people around the world depend on their products for information, social interaction and commerce. American regulators have also sued Apple, Amazon and Meta in recent years for monopolistic behavior, and Google’s case is likely to set a legal precedent for the group.“This will be the most important decision and the most important antitrust trial of the 21st century,” said Rebecca Haw Allensworth, a professor at Vanderbilt Law School who studies antitrust. “It’s the first of the major monopolization cases against the major tech platforms to go to trial, and so that makes it a bellwether.”",By David McCabe,2024-05-02 05:04:04-04:00,technology,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/02/technology/google-antitrust-trial-closing-arguments.html,The New York Times
150,"Hey, A.I. Let’s Talk","A pair of glasses from Meta shoots a picture when you say, “Hey, Meta, take a photo.” A miniature computer that clips to your shirt, the Ai Pin, translates foreign languages into your native tongue. An artificially intelligent screen features a virtual assistant that you talk to through a microphone.Last year, OpenAI updated its ChatGPT chatbot to respond with spoken words, and recently, Google introduced Gemini, a replacement for its voice assistant on Android phones.Tech companies are betting on a renaissance for voice assistants, many years after most people decided that talking to computers was uncool.Will it work this time? Maybe, but it could take a while.Large swaths of people have still never used voice assistants like Amazon’s Alexa, Apple’s Siri and Google’s Assistant, and the overwhelming majority of those who do said they never wanted to be seen talking to them in public, according to studies done in the last decade.I, too, seldom use voice assistants, and in my recent experiment with Meta’s glasses, which include a camera and speakers to provide information about your surroundings, I concluded that talking to a computer in front of parents and their children at a zoo was still staggeringly awkward.It made me wonder if this would ever feel normal. Not long ago, talking on the phone with Bluetooth headsets made people look batty, but now everyone does it. Will we ever see lots of people walking around and talking to their computers as in sci-fi movies?",By Brian X.

151,Amazon Reports $143.3 Billion in Revenue for First Quarter of 2024,"Amazon reported its highest first-quarter profit on Tuesday as it continued to wring efficiencies out of its retail business and recharge growth in its cloud computing operations.The company was also for the first time on track to have $100 billion in annual cloud computing sales.The company had $143.3 billion in revenue in the first three months of the year, up 13 percent from a year earlier. Profit more than tripled, to $10.4 billion. The results beat analysts’ expectations.“It was a good start to the year across the business, and you can see that in both our customer experience improvements and financial results,” Andy Jassy, Amazon’s chief executive, said in a statement.After a year of companies paring back tech spending, Amazon’s lucrative cloud computing business has been regaining steam. Sales from cloud computing were up 17 percent, to $25 billion. The growth was the fastest pace in more than a year. Operating income for that business grew 84 percent to $9.4 billion, accounting for most of the company’s operating profit.Amazon’s share price was up more than 3 percent in after-hours trading on Tuesday.Amazon spent about $14 billion on capital expenses and leases in the quarter, a figure particularly driven by investments in cloud computing, Brian Olsavsky, Amazon’s finance chief, said on a call with investors. That amount was about $1 billion more than for the same period last year. He said Amazon expected to spend more as the year goes on, “primarily to serve the generative A.I. opportunities that we are seeing.” ",By Karen Weise,2024-04-30 16:37:11-04:00,technology,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/30/technology/amazon-first-quarter-revenue.html,The New York Times
152,"Tesla Fires Many on Charger Team, Raising Doubts About Expansion","Elon Musk has gutted the part of Tesla responsible for building electric vehicle charging stations, sowing uncertainty about the future of the largest and most reliable U.S. charging network.The layoffs of about 500 Tesla employees, which many of them posted about on social media on Tuesday, raised questions about deals that Mr. Musk, Tesla’s chief executive, struck with the leaders of General Motors, Ford Motor and other automakers last year allowing cars made by other companies to use Tesla Supercharger stations.Tesla’s agreements with other makers of electric cars assured buyers that they would be able to find fast chargers on road trips, addressing one of the main reasons that many people are hesitant to buy such cars. It was also seen as a coup for Mr. Musk, validating Tesla’s technology and giving the company outsize influence over the auto industry.Almost all major manufacturers announced plans to switch the hardware and software in their cars to make them compatible with Tesla’s chargers. Ford has been mailing adapters to owners of its older electric vehicles so they can connect to Tesla’s chargers.Mr. Musk said on X, the social media site he owns, that Tesla would slow down construction of new charging stations and increase its “focus on 100% uptime and expansion of existing locations.”On Monday, in an email to employees that was reviewed by The New York Times, Mr. Musk said he would dissolve the “entire group of approximately 500 people” that had worked on building new Supercharger stations. In that message, he said the company would finish stations under construction and build some new ones “where critical.”",By Jack Ewing,2024-04-30 16:03:47-04:00,business,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/30/business/tesla-layoffs-supercharger-team.html,The New York Times
153,Binance Founder Sentenced to 4 Months in Prison,"Changpeng Zhao, the billionaire founder of the giant cryptocurrency exchange Binance, was sentenced on Tuesday to four months in prison, a much lighter penalty than other crypto executives have faced since the industry imploded in 2022.Mr. Zhao pleaded guilty last year to a money-laundering violation, acknowledging that his company allowed terrorist groups and other criminals to have access to its platform. Defense lawyers asked for probation without any prison time, while prosecutors requested a three-year sentence, calling it an “unprecedented” crime.But Judge Richard A. Jones, who oversaw the case in U.S. District Court in Seattle, said in court on Tuesday that Mr. Zhao had taken responsibility for his offenses and was unlikely to break the law again.“Your conduct does not warrant a 36-month sentence,” Judge Jones said. He called Mr. Zhao “a dedicated family man and a giving person” and praised his “staggering accomplishment” in building Binance.Wearing a dark suit and light blue tie, Mr. Zhao, 47, did not visibly react as the sentence was announced. But he nodded vigorously during Judge Jones’s statement and touched his hand to his heart.“I failed here,” Mr. Zhao said in brief remarks to the court. “I deeply regret my failure, and I’m sorry.”",By David Yaffe-Bellany,2024-04-30 15:01:56-04:00,technology,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/30/technology/binance-founder-changpeng-zhao-sentenced.html,The New York Times
154,Meet the Men Who Eat Meat (and Only Meat),"“Girl dinner” this is not.In a social media trend that won’t stop, ravenous meat eaters, mostly men, show themselves chomping on rib-eye steaks, bacon and innards.Listen to this article with reporter commentaryIn a recent online video, a popular TikTok user who posts as @carnivoreray unveiled a new snack recipe. After sliding sheet pans packed with fatty bacon strips into the oven, he melted two sticks of butter from grass-fed cows. Once the bacon was crisp, he poured the melted butter into the sheet pans. Then he popped the concoction into the freezer.The next morning, the influencer bit into the frozen treat while filming himself for his roughly 170,000 TikTok followers. “This tastes like candy,” he said. (The person behind the account did not reply to requests for comment.)The video belongs to an enduring social media genre quarterbacked largely by muscular fellows who claim that a meat-heavy diet is the key to mental and physical well-being.A stricter version of high-fat, low-carb regimens like the Atkins diet and keto, the carnivore diet consists of meat, seafood and eggs — period. While some add dairy and a little fruit to the mix, the strictest proponents adhere to what they call B.B.B.E — that is, beef, bacon, butter and eggs.",By Steven Kurutz,2024-04-30 10:38:04-04:00,style,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/30/style/meet-the-men-who-eat-meat-and-only-meat.html,The New York Times
155,‘Smartphones on Wheels’ Draw Attention From Regulators,"In the American imagination, car keys and a driver’s license have long represented freedom, autonomy and privacy. But modern cars, which have hundreds of sensors, cameras and internet connectivity, are now potential spying machines acting in ways drivers do not completely understand.That has lawmakers and regulators concerned.On Tuesday, Senators Ron Wyden of Oregon and Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts sent a letter to Lina Khan, chair of the Federal Trade Commission, urging the agency to investigate automakers for sharing drivers’ location information with the police. The senators, both Democrats, say this sharing can “seriously threaten Americans’ privacy” by revealing their visits to protests, health clinics, places of worship, support groups or other sensitive places.“As far-right politicians escalate their war on women, I’m especially concerned about cars revealing people who cross state lines to obtain an abortion,” Senator Wyden said in a statement.Government attention to the car industry is intensifying, experts say, because of the increased technological sophistication of modern cars.Investigators for the Government Accountability Office recently went car shopping, undercover, to see whether salespeople were overselling autonomous driving abilities. In a March report, the agency concluded that consumers don’t fully understand crash avoidance technologies and driver support systems, the improper use of which “can compromise their safety benefits and even pose a risk on the road.”The Federal Communications Commission and California lawmakers want to prevent mobile car apps from being used for stalking and harassment. The F.C.C. has proposed regulating automakers under the Safe Connections Act — aimed, originally, at phone carriers — while California is likely to pass a law that would accomplish the same thing, requiring car companies to cut off abusers’ remote access to victims’ cars.",By Kashmir Hill,2024-04-30 10:03:27-04:00,technology,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/30/technology/regulators-investigate-carmakers-driver-tracking.html,The New York Times
156,"Killer Asteroid Hunters Spot 27,500 Overlooked Space Rocks","A couple of years ago, a team of researchers dedicated to finding killer asteroids before they kill us came up with a neat trick.Instead of scanning the skies with telescopes for asteroids, the scientists wrote an algorithm that sifts through old pictures of the night sky, discovering about 100 asteroids that had been overlooked in those images.On Tuesday, those scientists, with the Asteroid Institute and the University of Washington, revealed an even bigger bounty: 27,500 newly identified solar system bodies.That is more than were discovered by all of the world’s telescopes last year.“This is a sea change” in how astronomical research will be conducted, said Ed Lu, the executive director of the institute, which is part of the B612 Foundation, a nonprofit group that Dr. Lu helped found.The finds include about 100 near-Earth asteroids, the space rocks that pass within the orbit of Earth. None of the 100 appear to be on a collision path with Earth anytime soon. But the algorithm could prove a key tool in spotting potentially dangerous asteroids, and the research assists the “planetary defense” efforts undertaken by NASA and other organizations around the world.Most of the space rocks identified by the institute lie in the main asteroid belt, between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. Others, known as Trojans, are trapped in the orbit of Jupiter. The search also found some small worlds much farther out known as Kuiper belt objects, beyond the orbit of Neptune.",By Kenneth Chang,2024-04-30 09:00:09-04:00,science,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/30/science/killer-asteroids-algorithm.html,The New York Times
157,Women on Bumble No Longer Have to Make the First Move,"As the sheen on dating apps dulls, more Americans are reporting bad experiences on them. Frustrated by bots, subscription costs and high effort-to-reward ratios, Gen Z is fleeing the apps in hope of real-life meet-cutes. Earlier this year, “Bustle” declared that dating apps are in their “flop era.”Not all of the apps are taking this backlash without a fight. On Tuesday, after months of internal shake-ups and stock market woes, Bumble took a shot at winning back hearts and minds with a redesign, which includes a break with the app’s requirement that women make the first move.A new feature, which the company has called “Opening Moves,” allows women to place on their profiles a question, like “What is your dream vacation?,” to which men who match can respond. (In nonbinary and same-gender matches, both sides can include these prompts.)The shift is a major one for Bumble. Until now, a man who matched with a woman on the app had to wait for her to message him. If she did not initiate a conversation, the match would expire after 24 hours.Whitney Wolfe Herd founded Bumble in 2014 because of her own personal experiences. She said that the idea was to give women more control. “I had a series of bad relationships, and I felt I was controlled by a man,” she added, “whether it was: Don’t wear this or, You can’t hang out with this person or, You need to be home at this time.”But over the years, Bumble received feedback from women who found that making the first move was “a lot of work” or “a burden,” and Ms. Wolfe Herd began thinking about how to release the pressure. Opening Moves, she said, is a result of that process, a way to let women maintain control while not feeling the stress of initiating all of the conversations.",By Valeriya Safronova,2024-04-30 08:11:34-04:00,style,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/30/style/bumble-dating-apps.html,The New York Times
158,Meta Faces E.U. Investigation Over Election Disinformation,"Meta, the American tech giant, is being investigated by European Union regulators for the spread of disinformation on its platforms Facebook and Instagram, poor oversight of deceptive advertisements and potential failure to protect the integrity of elections.On Tuesday, European Union officials said Meta did not appear to have sufficient safeguards in place to combat misleading advertisements, deepfakes and other deceptive information that is being maliciously spread online to amplify political divisions and influence elections.The announcement appears intended to pressure Meta to do more ahead of elections across all 27 E.U. countries this summer to elect new members of the European Parliament. The vote, from June 6-9, is being closely watched for signs of foreign interference, particularly from Russia, which has sought to weaken European support for the war in Ukraine.The Meta investigation shows how European regulators are taking a more aggressive approach to regulate online content than authorities in the United States, where free speech and other legal protections limit the role the government can play in policing online discourse. An E.U. law that took effect last year, the Digital Services Act, gives regulators broad authority to rein in Meta and other large online platforms over the content shared through their services.“Big digital platforms must live up to their obligations to put enough resources into this, and today’s decision shows that we are serious about compliance,” Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, the European Union’s executive branch, said in a statement.European officials said Meta must address weaknesses in its content moderation system to better identify malicious actors and take down concerning content. They noted a recent report by AI Forensics, a civil society group in Europe, that identified a Russian information network that was purchasing misleading ads through fake accounts and other methods.",By Adam Satariano,2024-04-30 07:00:22-04:00,business,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/30/business/meta-european-union-disinformation-investigation.html,The New York Times
159,From Baby Talk to Baby A.I.,"We ask a lot of ourselves as babies. Somehow we must grow from sensory blobs into mobile, rational, attentive communicators in just a few years. Here you are, a baby without a vocabulary, in a room cluttered with toys and stuffed animals. You pick up a Lincoln Log and your caretaker tells you, “This is a ‘log.’” Eventually you come to understand that “log” does not refer strictly to this particular brown plastic cylinder or to brown plastic cylinders in general, but to brown plastic cylinders that embody the characteristics of felled, denuded tree parts, which are also, of course, “logs.”Listen to this article with reporter commentaryThere has been much research and heated debate around how babies accomplish this. Some scientists have argued that most of our language acquisition can be explained by associative learning, as we relate sounds to sensibilia, much like dogs associate the sound of a bell with food. Others claim that there are features built into the human mind that have shaped the forms of all language, and are crucial to our learning. Still others contend that toddlers build their understanding of new words on top of their understanding of other words.This discourse advanced on a recent Sunday morning, as Tammy Kwan and Brenden Lake delivered blackberries from a bowl into the mouth of their twenty-one-month-old daughter, Luna. Luna was dressed in pink leggings and a pink tutu, with a silicone bib around her neck and a soft pink hat on her head. A lightweight GoPro-type camera was attached to the front.“Babooga,” she said, pointing a round finger at the berries. Dr. Kwan gave her the rest, and Dr. Lake looked at the empty bowl, amused. “That’s like $10,” he said. A light on the camera blinked.For an hour each week over the past 11 months, Dr. Lake, a psychologist at New York University whose research focuses on human and artificial intelligence, has been attaching a camera to Luna and recording things from her point of view as she plays. His goal is to use the videos to train a language model using the same sensory input that a toddler is exposed to — a LunaBot, so to speak. By doing so, he hopes to create better tools for understanding both A.I. and ourselves. “We see this research as finally making that link, between those two areas of study,” Dr. Lake said. “You can finally put them in dialogue with each other.”",By Oliver Whang,2024-04-30 03:00:14-04:00,science,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/30/science/ai-infants-language-learning.html,The New York Times

He visited Telluride, Colo., and Moab, Utah, a vacation spot known for its national parks. And he chatted about start-ups with Sam Altman, the chief executive of OpenAI.After pleading guilty to a money-laundering violation in November, Changpeng Zhao, the founder of the cryptocurrency exchange Binance, did not sit still. A federal judge denied his request to return home to Dubai, but Mr. Zhao, 47, was free to roam the United States. So he spent the past five months traveling the country, networking with other entrepreneurs and laying the groundwork for his next act.When he pleaded guilty, Mr. Zhao, once the most powerful figure in the global crypto industry, resigned as Binance’s chief executive and agreed to pay a $50 million fine. On Tuesday, a federal judge in Seattle sentenced him to four months in prison; prosecutors had sought a three-year prison term, while defense lawyers had asked for probation and no time behind bars.But Mr. Zhao, who goes by the initials CZ, is already looking to the future. He has a $33 billion fortune, according to Forbes, and he announced last month that he was starting a new web platform to promote online education.Mr. Zhao has also expressed interest in investing in artificial intelligence and biotechnology, and has corresponded with other executives. Late last year, he and Mr. Altman exchanged text messages, two people familiar with the matter said, and discussed the challenges of expanding a start-up worldwide.Many powerful crypto executives have faced federal lawsuits and criminal charges since the multitrillion-dollar industry imploded in 2022.

161,A.I. Start-Ups Face a Rough Financial Reality Check,"Leer en españolCall it the end of the beginning of the A.I. boom.Since mid-March, the financial pressure on several signature artificial intelligence start-ups has taken a toll. Inflection AI, which raised $1.5 billion but made almost no money, has folded its original business. Stability AI has laid off employees and parted ways with its chief executive. And Anthropic has raced to close the roughly $1.8 billion gap between its modest sales and enormous expenses.The A.I. revolution, it is becoming clear in Silicon Valley, is going to come with a very big price tag. And the tech companies that have bet their futures on it are scrambling to figure out how to close the gap between those expenses and the profits they hope to make somewhere down the line.This problem is particularly acute for a group of high-profile start-ups that have raised tens of billions of dollars for the development of generative A.I., the technology behind chatbots such as ChatGPT. Some of them are already figuring out that competing head-on with giants like Google, Microsoft and Meta is going to take billions of dollars — and even that may not be enough.“You can already see the writing on the wall,” said Ali Ghodsi, chief executive of Databricks, a data warehouse and analysis company that works with A.I. start-ups. “It doesn’t matter how cool it is what you do — does it have business viability?”While plenty of money has been burned in other tech booms, the expense of building A.I. systems has shocked tech industry veterans. Unlike the iPhone, which kicked off the last technology transition and cost a few hundred million dollars to develop because it largely relied on existing components, generative A.I. models cost billions to create and maintain. The cutting-edge chips they need are expensive and in short supply. And every query of an A.I. system costs far more than a simple Google search.Investors have poured $330 billion into about 26,000 A.I. and machine-learning start-ups over the past three years, according to PitchBook, which tracks the industry. That’s two-thirds more than the amount they spent funding 20,350 A.I. companies from 2018 through 2020.","By Cade Metz, Karen Weise and Tripp Mickle",2024-04-29 00:01:15-04:00,technology,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/29/technology/ai-startups-financial-reality.html,The New York Times
162,Friends From the Old Neighborhood Turn Rivals in Big Tech’s A.I. Race,"Mustafa Suleyman grew up in subsidized housing in one of London’s roughest areas. His father, a Syrian immigrant, drove a taxi. His mother was a nurse with the National Health Service. When the prestigious Queen Elizabeth’s School accepted him at the age of 11, the family moved into a safer, leafier neighborhood a few miles north.There, he met 20-year-old Demis Hassabis, after becoming friends with his younger brother. Demis was a chess prodigy and video game designer whose parents — one a Greek Cypriot, the other a Singaporean — ran a London toy store.Today, they are two of the most powerful executives in the tech industry’s race to build artificial intelligence. Dr. Hassabis, 47, is the chief executive of Google DeepMind, the tech giant’s central research lab for artificial intelligence. Mr. Suleyman, 39, was recently named chief executive of Microsoft AI, charged with overseeing the company’s push into A.I. consumer products.Their path from London to the executive suites of Big Tech is one of the most unusual — and personal — stories in an industry full of colorful personalities and cutting rivalries. In 2010, they were two of the three founders of DeepMind, a seminal A.I. research lab that was supposed to prevent the very thing they are now deeply involved in: an escalating race by profit-driven companies to build and deploy A.I.Their paths diverged after a clash at DeepMind, which Google acquired for $650 million in 2014. When the A.I. race kicked off in late 2022 with the arrival of the ChatGPT online chatbot, Google put Dr. Hassabis in charge of its A.I. research. Mr. Suleyman took a rockier route — founding another A.I. start-up, Inflection AI, that struggled to gain traction before Microsoft unexpectedly hired him and most of his employees.“We’ve always seen the world differently, but we’ve been aligned in believing that this is going to be the next great transition in technology,” Mr. Suleyman said of his old family friend in an interview. “It is always a friendly and respectful rivalry.”",By Cade Metz and Nico Grant,2024-04-29 00:01:13-04:00,technology,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/29/technology/ai-google-microsoft.html,The New York Times
163,"In Race to Build A.I., Tech Plans a Big Plumbing Upgrade"," is turning out to be the year of A.I. plumbing. It may not sound as exciting, but tens of billions of dollars are quickly being spent on behind-the-scenes technology for the industry’s A.I. boom.Companies from Amazon to Meta are revamping their data centers to support artificial intelligence. They are investing in huge new facilities, while even places like Saudi Arabia are racing to build supercomputers to handle A.I. Nearly everyone with a foot in tech or giant piles of money, it seems, is jumping into a spending frenzy that some believe could last for years.Microsoft, Meta, and Google’s parent company, Alphabet, disclosed this week that they had spent more than $32 billion combined on data centers and other capital expenses in just the first three months of the year. The companies all said in calls with investors that they had no plans to slow down their A.I. spending.In the clearest sign of how A.I. has become a story about building a massive technology infrastructure, Meta said on Wednesday that it needed to spend billions more on the chips and data centers for A.I. than it had previously signaled.“I think it makes sense to go for it, and we’re going to,” Mark Zuckerberg, Meta’s chief executive, said in a call with investors.The eye-popping spending reflects an old parable in Silicon Valley: The people who made the biggest fortunes in California’s gold rush weren’t the miners — they were the people selling the shovels.

164,The Big Number: $40 Billion,"Share full article






The Big Number: $40 BillionMarie SolisReporting on the business news of the weekMeta has already spent billions on developing artificial intelligence. On Wednesday, the company said it would spend as much as $40 billion this year, much of it going toward data centers, chip designs and research.Here’s what to know → Josie NortonJust before the announcement, Meta rolled out smart assistants across its platforms. The assistants are powered by the company’s A.I. language model, which can generate prose, conversations and images.It is the latest way Meta is trying to make good on the promise of its leader, Mark Zuckerberg, to introduce A.I. software “to billions of people in ways that will be useful and meaningful.”Carlos Barria/ReutersBut despite Meta’s bullishness on the technology — and despite the 27 percent increase in the company’s revenue and profit, its best ever in the first quarter — there were some caveats. Meta said it anticipated second-quarter revenue to be lower than analysts had expected. Those words of caution appeared to unsettle investors, who sank Meta’s stock by more than 16 percent in after-hours trading on Wednesday afternoon.Thibault Camus/Associated PressZuckerberg urged patience, telling analysts that stock volatility was not uncommon at times when Meta was “scaling a new product” but not yet making money from it.

165,Auto Safety Regulator Investigating Tesla Recall of Autopilot,"The federal government’s main auto safety agency said on Friday that it was investigating Tesla’s recall of its Autopilot driver-assistance system because regulators were concerned that the company had not done enough to ensure that drivers remained attentive while using the technology.The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said in documents posted on its website that it was looking into Tesla’s recall in December of two million vehicles, which covered nearly all of the cars the company had manufactured in the United States since 2012. The safety agency said it had concerns about crashes that took place after the recall and results from preliminary tests of recalled vehicles.The agency also published an analysis that found that there had been at least 29 fatal accidents involving Autopilot and a more advanced system that Tesla calls Full Self-Driving from January 2018 to August 2023. In 13 of those fatal accidents, the fronts of Teslas hit objects or people in their path.The investigation of Tesla’s recall and the new data about crashes adds to a list of headaches for Tesla, the dominant electric-vehicle maker in the United States. The company’s sales in the first three months of the year fell more than 8 percent from a year earlier, the first such drop since the early days of the coronavirus pandemic.Tesla announced in December that it would recall its Autopilot software after an investigation by the auto safety agency found that the carmaker hadn’t put in place enough safeguards to make sure the system, which can accelerate, brake and control cars in other ways, was used safely by drivers who were supposed to be ready at any moment to retake control of their cars using Autopilot.In its analysis of Tesla crash data, the safety agency found that when the company’s cameras, sensors and software did not spot obstacles in the car’s path and drivers did not compensate for that failure quickly enough the consequences were often catastrophic.",By J.

0, ,"Oxford has a severe housing problem. With house prices 12 times the average salary, it has become one of the least affordable cities in the country. Its council house waiting list has grown to more than 3,000 households, with many having to live in temporary accommodation. An obvious solution is to build more homes, but those trying to do this face a big barrier: electricity. “When I talk to developers or potential developers, one of the first questions they now ask me is about grid capacity,” says Susan Brown, leader of Oxford city council. With housing developments competing for power against energy-hungry tech companies and the city’s increasingly electrified transport network, connection prospects are a matter of concern for housebuilders. “The problem [for developers] is securing sufficient energy, and the time it takes to connect to the grid,” Brown says. The council estimates that 26,000 new homes will be needed in and around the city by 2040, but it fears any building plans could be delayed by capacity constraints. In the nearby market town of Bicester, this has already happened. “The latest expansion in Bicester was supposed to see an additional 7,000 homes and a large commercial zone built, but they’ve been put on pause because grid reinforcements are needed to get them further,” says Brown, who is also a vice-chair of the District Councils’ Network, a cross-party group of 169 district and unitary councils in England. “I don’t think Oxfordshire is unique at all. I know it is becoming quite a big issue across the country.” This inability to build enough homes is not a new problem. For the past decade, sluggish building rates have meant the government’s target of 300,000 homes a year has been repeatedly missed, while the housing crisis has worsened. Funding and planning issues are routinely blamed for the country’s supply issues; a lack of electricity supply has rarely been given as a reason why homes are not built – until recently. “Securing capacity has always been a priority, but over the past 18 months, it has become a significant roadblock and a real challenge for developers across the country,” says Vicki Spiers, chair of the Independent Networks Association, whose members are responsible for connecting 80% of new UK homes to the grid.
And as households move away from using fossil fuels to heat homes and power cars, the challenge will only grow. “We can see examples of developments being knocked back because of grid capacity,” says energy expert Adam Bell of Stonehaven Consulting. “That problem will only get worse in the future without expansion of the distribution network.” Just like the capacity issues facing housing developments, the country’s electricity system is complex, and growing more so. National Grid is responsible for the transmission network, which acts as a motorway transporting electricity from power sources to other parts of the country along high-voltage lines. After this come 14 distribution network operators (DNOs), the equivalent of A-roads, all responsible for distribution within a region. These connect either directly to housing developments or, more often, through independent network operators. In a country where electricity use is expected to increase by 50% by 2035, as millions of electric cars and domestic heat pumps are plugged in, the transmission network will require significant upgrades, at a cost of tens of billions of pounds. But it is at the distribution level, the A-roads, that the biggest roadblocks come for housing developments. The operators are often left waiting for major National Grid transmission upgrades to provide extra capacity to their network, but the five-year funding cycles set by regulator Ofgem mean local upgrade plans can become outdated as demand changes. Bell says: “These [cycles] made sense in a slow-paced world where demand grew through economic growth and population growth, but now that we are electrifying stuff, more data centres are coming online and the view taken five years ago is going to be wrong.” Even when upgrades or new connections are agreed on, completion can take years. Spiers says this is forcing more and more developers to mothball building projects. The Observer has spoken to several developers who have had to scale down, change or scrap plans because of electricity capacity issues. One developer was forced to shrink a development of more than 80 homes to fewer than 20 because it could not secure enough electricity. Another said capacity limitations meant it had had to cut the number of electric car chargers on a site. In an extreme example, one building firm scrapped a planned development of almost 100 homes after a £570,000 charge to secure a new connection made the scheme unviable.
The most high-profile example of electricity shortages causing housing delays is in the west London boroughs of Hounslow, Hillingdon and Ealing. The area has become popular over recent years with data centre developers, thanks to the fibre optic cables that run along the M4 corridor to the Atlantic. Crucially, for an area with a large housing shortage, they have sucked up capacity that could have been used for vital housing schemes. In 2022, the Greater London Authority sounded the alarm over the power shortages, warning that all developments in the area could be paused until 2035, when new transmission connections would be constructed. Building of new infrastructure has now restarted and the National Grid and Scottish and Southern Electricity Network (SSEN) have come up with solutions to flatten out demand. These have included accelerating smaller housing developments, and striking deals with developers to build developments in phases to better match the extra capacity added to the network. But while progress has been made and 7,800 homes are now connected, 3,900 planned units, including 1,855 affordable homes, are still waiting to secure a power supply. Situations like the one in west London will become more common as the government’s Future Homes Standard legislation turbocharges the electrification of homes. The new law, which will come into force next year, will reduce the maximum permitted carbon emissions of all new homes by 75%-80%. David Adams, strategic adviser at the Future Homes Hub (which was set up to develop a long-term delivery plan for the sector) says this will effectively ban the use of fossil fuels in homes, and make electric heat pumps the only option.
According to the National Grid electricity system operator (ESO), the body that ensures supply meets demand on the network, heat pumps will require 80 terawatt hours a year by 2050, if the country is to hit its decarbonisation goal. This is four times the current usage, but achieving this could be hampered by capacity constraints. Last year, Reading borough council raised concerns that its net zero housing ambitions could be curtailed because of SSEN restrictions on new connections. On a planned development of more than 220 homes with heat pumps, nearly two-thirds converted back to gas after capacity concerns were raised. “We had a developer that was willing to fit air source heat pumps, fit electric car chargers, but couldn’t get the capacity, and had to come back to planning so it could fit gas boilers,” says Micky Leng, the council’s planning lead. “This is a massive issue that has the potential to put the country’s race to net zero at risk.” The Energy Network Association, the body that represents district network operators, says connection issues are rare for housing projects, but where they do occur operators are working to find solutions. It adds that in most cases connections usually take a little over a year from a request being made, and that the past year has seen its members deliver enough additional capacity to power a million homes. But the Home Builders Federation says this is becoming a bigger issue for its members, and will only get worse. A spokesperson says: “Moving away from gas for heating will increase electricity usage and we have seen elsewhere that if there isn’t the grid capacity, the answer is to not allow any new housing.” Upgrading infrastructure at both National Grid and the distribution network will be key to this. Adams at the Future Home Hub suggests that smart energy technologies could provide a solution by using existing capacity more efficiently, and that installing batteries in housing schemes could also help. DNOs are also increasing adopting “flexibility models”, in which they buy excess energy from local generators of power, for example homes or businesses with solar panels, to increase grid supply. For Brown, the solutions for Oxfordshire can’t come soon enough. She says: “What concerns me is that it is delaying housing, making it more expensive, and it is affecting our ability to make housing zero carbon, which is so important.”",,2024-05-04 13:00:41+00:00,Business,https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/may/04/capacity-crunch-why-the-uk-doesnt-have-the-power-to-solve-housing-crisis,The Guardian
1,,"It would come as a shock to most economists if the Bank of England opted to cut interest rates at its policy meeting this week. Financial markets, which were baying for a cut last May, are these days betting that August or possibly September will be the point at which the Bank starts to lower interest rates from their current level of 5.25%. The reason for the delay can be found in the UK’s improving economy, which some on the Bank’s monetary policy committee (MPC) believe could trigger the return of inflation later in the year. Higher shop prices would be embarrassing if victory in the fight against inflation had already been declared. Would the central bank have to raise interest rates again if that happened? Inside the Grade I-listed Threadneedle Street edifice that houses the Bank of England’s headquarters, a U-turn is considered unconscionable. And if the economy can grow when interest rates stand at 5.25%, why hurry to bring down the cost of borrowing? In an election year, the government might feel more of a sense of urgency about a reduction. After the historic swing against the Conservatives in the Blackpool South byelection and the loss of many council seats, a return to some kind of normal economic progress is considered by many ministers to be their best hope in the battle with Labour. With inflation forecast to fall below the 2% target as early as next month, pressure on the Bank to cut rates, and by more than once this year, is likely to intensify as Tory frustration grows. The independent Bank will be more focused, however, on the dismay among businesses and mortgage-payers needing to refinance their loans. If consumer and business confidence, which has improved in recent months, goes into reverse, the economy will suffer and dramatic cuts in interest rates will be needed to spur a revival. How robustly the UK has recovered from its recession last year will be revealed by the Office for National Statistics when figures covering the economy’s performance over the first three months of this year are published on Friday.
The ONS is expected to say the economy grew by 0.4% in the first quarter of 2024, after shrinking by 0.3% in the final quarter of 2023 and by 0.1% in the quarter before that. A bounce-back in consumer spending, driven by higher wages, is expected to be offset by poor trade figures and the general lack of momentum that led to the economy shrinking in the second half of 2023. Taken together, the likelihood is that growth will struggle to achieve a quickening pace this year. Among the forecasters, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) is gloomy about the UK economy, downgrading growth forecasts for 2024 to 0.4% from 0.7% and predicting the UK will be the slowest-growing G7 economy in 2025. At the more optimistic end of the spectrum, the government’s independent forecasting unit, the Office for Budget Responsibility, has pencilled in growth of 0.8%. Neither estimates measures up to the 2.6% rise in GDP that the OECD expects in the US this year. That forecast explains why the head of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, signalled last week that it could be some time before the US’s central bank sanctioned an interest rate cut. Those who worry about the money supply, including Prof Costas Milas at the University of Liverpool management school, argue that high interest rates and tight government spending could tip the UK back into recession. It is unclear what strategy the Bank intends to follow. On the one hand, its governor, Andrew Bailey, says it should not simply follow the Fed, indicating early rate cuts are possible. On the other, several members of the MPC have talked tough, arguing that even if GDP is increasing only modestly, that still does not warrant a rate cut when there is a lack of skilled workers in many important sectors of the economy. Worker shortages could be the impulse for higher wages throughout the year, and that could, they say, spark the return of the inflation that the Bank fears.",,2024-05-04 10:00:38+00:00,Business,https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/may/04/should-the-bank-of-england-cut-interest-rates-with-britains-economy-in-bloom,The Guardian
2, ,"Volkswagen owners targeted by thieves who have stolen cruise control sensors from cars across London are furious after discovering the car’s “poor design” that makes them so easy to steal is set to cost them £1,600 each. The sensors, which cost about £700 each, are fitted behind the VW badge, and appear to be a popular target for thieves. A VW specialist in the Midlands said he had experienced a big jump in sensor thefts “in the last few months”, and in recent weeks, motorists across the capital have been reporting thefts on social media groups. Tara O’Driscoll, from Clapham in south-west London, said she had fallen victim to the crime and had heard of more than 50 other reports of thefts in the borough since posting on social media about her experience. On some London roads, owners have reported that every VW car that features the sensor has had it taken. She has been told it will cost about £1,600 to replace the sensor on what she described as her “very ordinary” VW Golf. “Every VW car in our area that has this sensor has been targeted and it has been the talk of the community on WhatsApp and other media, not least as the bills to fix it are so big. It seems the part itself is expensive and only VW can calibrate it to work with your car,” she said. “People face having to make expensive insurance claims which will only push up their premiums for years to come, or pay the £1,600 upfront.”
The part is vital to the car’s adaptive cruise control (ACC) as it measures the distance to the vehicle in front, and adjusts the driving speed accordingly. However, it is easily accessible and is held in place by three screws. VW owners first began reporting the theft of ACC sensors in 2016, and some have been hit by a second theft after the first was replaced. Owners are questioning why VW has not fixed this known problem. They now want VW to come up with a cost-effective solution – and an improved design to stop it happening again. The company has, so far, refused. O’Driscoll said: “Given that it is clearly such a poor design, we feel that VW should be making a contribution – or at least doing the work at cost. If we have the work done, what’s to stop it being stolen again the next week?” Rebecca Phillips, another Clapham resident whose VW Passat was similarly targeted recently, said she was furious that the manufacturer was not offering a cheaper solution. “When we searched online, it soon became clear this has been happening for years,” she said. “There are videos showing how easy it is to steal these sensors, and yet nothing has been done. Our car is now beeping safety warnings at us and VW has told us not to drive it until it is repaired.” A VW spokesperson said: “We are sorry to hear about the issues being faced by this group of customers and we have advised them that this is, first and foremost, a matter all victims should discuss with local police. This does appear to be a localised crime issue and we are not aware of similar incidents happening elsewhere in the country.” The company said it does not believe that this problem can be attributed to a design flaw or defect, and therefore it will not be offering any financial help to the owners. It said that a missing radar sensor would not result in an MOT failure, as owners have feared. “As this part is chassis-stamped, it can, once reported to us via the police, be locked so that it is inoperable on another vehicle – and as a result worthless on the black market,” the spokesperson said. The VW sensors are the latest expensive car parts to be targeted by thieves. There have previously been similar spates of Land Rover headlight and hybrid car catalytic converter thefts.",,2024-05-04 07:00:37+00:00,Business,https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/may/04/vw-cars-parts-theft-cruise-control-sensors-insurance-golf-passat,The Guardian
3,,"HSBC’s chief executive, Noel Quinn, is seen by many as ending his five-year tenure on a high note. The 62-year-old stunned the banking world this week by saying he planned to retire after an “intense” five years in the role to get a better work-life balance. Quinn has slimmed down a sprawling global bank, paid out $19bn (£15bn) to shareholders last year and successfully staved off calls to break up the lender.
But Quinn’s fans were clearly not in attendance at HSBC’s annual meeting in London on Friday, where angry pensioners heckled bosses for clawing back their retirement payments and campaigners pushed bosses on climate commitments. On the sidelines, shareholders such as Geoff Gaskin said that Quinn had “done well as far as the dividend is concerned”, while another conceded that HSBC “couldn’t make money by acting on principles alone”. Their hopes for Quinn’s successor? Perhaps a more dynamic leader to take his place. “He’s no Jamie Dimon,” another shareholder of 20 years, John Threlfall, said of Birmingham-born Quinn.
But HSBC is no JP Morgan. And if there is one thing that bankers and investors can agree on, it is that helming a bank such as HSBC is not for the faint of heart. Headquartered in London, but making the bulk of its profits in China, the 159-year-old bank has always had to tread a fine political line between east and west. That tightrope walk will get exponentially harder if Donald Trump returns to the White House and imposes new sanctions on China. It will need to be someone who possesses “a really, deep emotional intelligence … someone who understands the reality of managing geopolitical risks, while still coming back to its core: someone who understands how a bank works,” one former adviser to HSBC bosses said. They will also have to be a seasoned crisis manager such as Quinn, who launched his career at the UK’s Midland Bank, before its takeover by HSBC in 1992. “Starting off your career at a tough time means that when you get into a cycle of complexity in business … those formative experiences help you have discipline and an understanding of how things work,” they said. It helped Quinn win over a tough chairman, his board, as well as the respect of staff. Having worked as a commercial banker, colleagues say he truly understood relationship banking and cross-border finance, key functions for a bank such as HSBC.
In August 2019, after more than three decades at the bank, the father of three was thrown into the chief executive role, initially on an interim basis, after the surprise departure of John Flint. His predecessor resigned just 18 months into the job amid tense disagreements with chairman Mark Tucker. It put Quinn in a challenging position: parachuted in to lead one of the world’s largest lenders under a chairman whose tough and domineering reputation preceded him, while knowing he was not Tucker’s first choice for the permanent job. One banker, for example, recounts a story of colleagues entering a meeting room to find Tucker – a former trainee professional footballer – holding someone in what appeared to be a friendly headlock. Chief financial officer Ewan Stevenson also quit in 2022, when it was made clear that Tucker did not see him taking the top job anytime soon.
Tucker was at pains to state that Quinn’s exit is amicable, saying the “only point of difference” between them was their respective football club allegiances. But a source said Quinn’s departure was at odds with his recent message to staff that he would stay for a few more years, and pointed to boardroom tension around HSBC’s results in February, when profits and shares plunged on a $3bn write down in China. Tucker was the first outsider to chair HSBC, having previously led Asia-focused insurer Prudential in the late 2000s. Some suggest the gruff approach was Tucker’s way of getting a handle on a bank that for years picked its leaders internally, with entrenched internal hierarchies and bureaucracies. Tucker quickly got his way, persuading Quinn into an ambitious cost-cutting agenda involving about 35,000 job losses – something that Flint is rumoured to have opposed. Meanwhile, Quinn was forced to navigate growing geopolitical tension, just as Beijing started to tighten its grip on Hong Kong. Matters escalated when HSBC bosses controversially accepted China’s authoritarian crackdown on democracy in Hong Kong in 2020. Quinn was soon expertly dodging questions from US and British politicians over HSBC’s willingness to work with an increasingly authoritarian Beijing. Critics say Quinn was “diplomatic to the point of being ineffectual, trying to please everyone while pleasing nobody,” said Andrew Harper, chief responsibility officer of HSBC investor Epworth Investment, which holds £7.7m in shares. By then, the Covid pandemic was in full swing, stifling dealmaking and pushing interest rates to record lows. UK regulators forced HSBC to cancel dividends, infuriating Asian investors. It prompted calls from HSBC’s top investor Ping An to break up the business and spin off its more profitable Asian operations to boost returns to shareholders. HSBC resisted, but Quinn got to work: accelerating a pivot towards Asia while selling off less profitable retail operations in western countries such as France and the US. Quinn and Tucker eventually won the war with Ping An, but split opinion along the way. One senior banker, who has worked closely with HSBC bosses, said pulling bank capital out of western democracies and into China was one “obvious misstep”. “It’s not just the Hong Kong crackdown. It’s the way [Chinese president] Xi [JinPing] is becoming increasingly authoritarian in terms of the domestic economy in China, and continues to demonstrate that if you put capital in China, it’s not really yours.” Meanwhile, Quinn’s sold the US and French retail bank before interest rates spiked. He “got the least possible value, and sold at the absolute bottom. This is why the share price is below where it was when Tucker took over as chair seven years ago,” they said. HSBC shares were trading around 706p on Friday, down from 737p when Tucker joined in October 2017. “It’ll be fascinating to see who they get next. It’s one of the most consequential jobs, and definitely not the easiest,” one former adviser said. But with Tucker’s time running out as chair, he will want someone willing to take directions, but also step up when he departs. The finance chief, Georges Elhedery, and Nuno Matos, the head of the wealth management operation, are viewed as leading contenders. Former HSBC executives, including Lloyds Banking Group boss Charlie Nunn and BlackRock vice-chairman Mark McCombe, have also been named as potential runners. “He’ll want someone who’s willing to be the ‘number two’ executive in the institution,” a senior banker said. “I suspect he’ll also be yearning for a star banker, but I’m not sure you’re going to get the combination of the two.”",,2024-05-03 17:14:48+00:00,Business,https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/may/03/geopolitical-tensions-and-covid-crisis-noel-quinns-five-years-at-hsbcs-helm,The Guardian
4,,"The global mining industry is braced for a multi-billion pound bidding war for Anglo American amid growing speculation that mining companies are preparing rival bids. The Australian miner BHP is understood to have sent senior executives to Anglo’s base in South Africa to meet key company stakeholders after an initial offer of £31bn was rebuffed by Anglo’s board last week. A revised bid from BHP is expected to face competition from Swiss mining company Glencore, which is understood to be considering its own approach. Meanwhile, the British-Australian miner Rio Tinto has also been linked to the multi-billion pound tug-of-war over Anglo’s vast reserves of copper, a key building block of low-carbon technologies including solar farms and electric vehicles. The market speculation prompted a 3% jump in Anglo’s share price on Friday, making it the top riser on the FTSE 100 and helping to drive the index to an all-time high of 8,215 points. Anglo’s share price rise gives the miner a market valuation of about £37bn, well above the proposed takeover price offered by the Australian miner BHP, which was rejected by Anglo’s board last week as an “opportunistic” and “unattractive” offer.
Industry analysts at Jefferies said this week that they expected BHP to return to the bargaining table with a “sweetened offer” but added that they “would be surprised if other bidders didn’t emerge”. One industry source said: “Glencore is definitely looking at an Anglo bid. There is no doubt that banks are already advising on what structure and price might make sense for them. I really can’t see them not doing anything.” A spokesperson for Glencore said the company did not comment on “market rumour or speculation”. The source added that Anglo was also likely to attract interest from Rio Tinto, which could set the stage for a three-way bidding war for the 107-year-old company. “This has a long way to run,” the source said. “It will take some time.” The Rio chair Dominic Barton remained tight-lipped on whether the company was considering making a play for Anglo when questioned during the company’s annual general meeting in Brisbane on Thursday. “Our policy is that we don’t speculate or comment on M&A activity. So that would be my comment,” Barton said. The Anglo chair, Stuart Chambers, was also constrained from commenting directly on the takeover speculation at the company’s annual shareholder meeting on Tuesday. But he signalled that the board expected further offers for the company. “It’s the shareholders who will decide whether they believe the offer should be accepted or not,” he told the AGM in London. “The board doesn’t buy or sell the company – the shareholders decide.”. Chambers said he would be meeting with Anglo’s largest shareholders “and listening very carefully” to “hear what they feel” about the future of the company. Glencore and Rio could prove to be a better fit for Anglo than BHP, which made clear in its approach that the takeover would require Anglo to spin off some of its South African businesses, including the Kumba iron ore mine and Anglo’s platinum business, Amplats. The BHP approach received a frosty reception in South Africa, which is Anglo’s largest shareholder through its Public Investment Corporation and home to many of its mines. Christopher LaFemina, an analyst at Jefferies, said last week: “Unlike BHP, Glencore could benefit from keeping Kumba and marketing iron ore, and Glencore may face less political pushback in South Africa, especially if it were to propose a straightforward all-share deal that does not include Kumba and Amplats demergers.” Rio was approached for comment. Anglo declined to comment.",,2024-05-03 11:43:17+00:00,Business,https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/may/03/glencore-may-trigger-bidding-war-for-mining-rival-anglo-american,The Guardian
5,Closing post,"Time to recap… Hiring in the US slowed in April with the workforce adding another 175,000 jobs and wage growth slowing. The news cheered investors hoping that a cooling labor market will prompt the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates – which have been driven to a 20-year high as the US fights stubbornly high inflation. All the major US markets rose in early trading. Last month, the labor department reported the US added a revised 315,000 jobs in March, far higher than the 192,000 jobs economists had forecast. April’s figure was lower than forecast and the unemployment rate ticked up from 3.8% to 3.9% over the month but the figures underlined the continuing strength of the jobs market. It was the 40th straight month of job gains in the US and the 27th consecutive month with the unemployment rate below 4% – the longest such streak since 1953. But the slowdown in job creation is fuelling expectations that US interest rates could be cut sooner than expected, with a September cut looking more likely. Here’s the full story:

7,Midland Clawback Campaign,"Back in London, HSBC shareholders have rejected the resolution to scrap the pension clawback which has cost its retired workers thousands of pounds per year. As we covered earlier, the Midland Clawback Campaign argues that HSBC is acting unfairly by cutting their company pension on the grounds that they also receive the state pension. Resolution 17 said: This Special Resolution seeks shareholders to instruct the board to align pension inequality with their commitment to reduce the gender pay gap, by removing the impact of State Deduction from the members of the post 1974 Midland Section of the HSBC Bank (UK) Pension Scheme. HSBC had advised investors to vote against this resolution, and they heeded this advice, with just 4% of votes cast in favour.

8,Fed’s Bowman says inflation to remain elevated for ‘some time’,"Federal Reserve Governor Michelle Bowman has slightly dampened the mood in the markets, by predicting that US inflation will likely remain elevated for “some time”. In remarks prepared for the Massachusetts Bankers Association Annual Convention in Key Biscayne, Florida, Bowman says: “I expect inflation to remain elevated for some time. “My baseline outlook continues to be that inflation will decline further with the policy rate held steady, but I still see a number of upside inflation risks that affect my outlook.”",,2024-05-03 14:28:26+00:00,Business,https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2024/may/03/oil-prices-weekly-drop-us-jobs-market-wages-stock-markets-business-live,The Guardian
9,Stephen,"The latest US jobs data has further fueled expectations of impending interest rate cuts and paints a picture of a soft landing on the economic horizon, says Stephen Innes, managing partner at SPI Asset Management. But if today’s report is revised lower in a month’s time, there be more concerns over the health of the US conomy. Innes says: According to the BLS release on Friday, the US economy added 175,000 jobs in April, a figure that could be deemed within the “Goldilocks zone.” Leading up to the release, there was a subtle and odd uptick in the “whisper” number, consequently, the 175,000 figure was perceived as a wider miss compared to the “official” consensus set at 240,000. Of particular encouragement for the Federal Reserve was the subdued reading of Average Hourly Earnings (AHE). AHE increased by only 0.2% from March (0.2019% when unrounded), falling below consensus expectations. Similarly, the year-over-year (YoY) growth rate of 3.9% was cooler than anticipated. This data should help alleviate concerns about “stagflation” prompted by the headline nonfarm payrolls (NFP) miss, as well as ease worries exacerbated by the Employment Cost Index (ECI) and Unit Labor Costs (ULC) overshooting in the first quarter. While the extent of the headline miss might fuel concerns about a recession, for the time being, 175,000 represents a fundamentally robust pace of hiring. Any significant downward revisions next month alongside another substantial miss may warrant cause for concern.",,2024-05-03 14:11:03+00:00,Business,https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2024/may/03/oil-prices-weekly-drop-us-jobs-market-wages-stock-markets-business-live,The Guardian

Overall, risk sentiment has been given a boost this week from a less hawkish Fed and payrolls data that is moving in the direction needed for interest rate cuts in the US.

Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management, says: “This is the jobs report the Fed would have scripted. The first downside payrolls surprise in several months, as well as the dip in average hourly earnings growth, will bring the rate cutting dialogue back into the market and perhaps explains why Powell was able to be dovish on Wednesday. Of course, today’s weaker numbers need to mark the start of a new slower trend for multiple rate cuts to seriously be back on the agenda - but, by then, the new fear could be a slowing economy.”",,2024-05-03 13:05:15+00:00,Business,https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2024/may/03/oil-prices-weekly-drop-us-jobs-market-wages-stock-markets-business-live,The Guardian
17,US non-farm payroll: snap reaction,"Reaction to the slowdown in US job creation is flooding in. Richard Flynn, managing director at Charles Schwab UK, says: “Investors will interpret today’s weak jobs report as a sign that demand is slowing in the labour market. Both markets and central bankers have been looking for evidence that disinflation may be ahead, and today’s figures could indicate that the economy is slowing down. In recent months, it has become clear that the Fed is happy to move slowly in the cutting part of the rate cycle, but unwanted and unexpected weakness in the economy, as we are seeing today, may cause a shift in this approach. A dive in the labour market may be what it takes to push the Fed from a stroll to a sprint.” Mahmoud Alkudsi, senior market analyst at ADSS, says: “This is a rare miss for the US jobs market which could potentially spell the end of the ‘higher for longer’ rhetoric we have become accustomed to. This will have surprised the Fed following Wednesday’s decision to hold interest rates further.” “Though the Fed will see this as a step towards getting comfortable with a cut in interest rates, the relative strength of the jobs market remains too high for them to consider a cut before late Q2.” And here’s Neil Birrell, chief investment officer at Premier Miton Investors: “What will the Fed make of this? At last there is evidence of some weakness in the US jobs market. Rate cuts will move back up the agenda as a result and there is little doubt that markets will take this as good news. While we shouldn’t make too much of single data prints, this could be the start of a positive trend for the Fed.”",,2024-05-03 12:50:37+00:00,Business,https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2024/may/03/oil-prices-weekly-drop-us-jobs-market-wages-stock-markets-business-live,The Guardian

25,,"Hiring in the US slowed in April with the workforce adding another 175,000 jobs and wage growth slowing. The news cheered investors hoping that a cooling labor market will prompt the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates – which have been driven to a 20-year high as the US fights stubbornly high inflation. All the major US markets rose on the news. Last month, the labor department reported the US added a revised 315,000 jobs in March, far higher than the 192,000 jobs economists had forecast. April’s figure was lower than forecast and the unemployment rate ticked up from 3.8% to 3.9% over the month but the figures underlined the continuing strength of the jobs market. It was the 40th straight month of job gains in the US and the 27th consecutive month with the unemployment rate below 4% – the longest such streak since 1953. Gains were broad-based, with healthcare, social assistance, transportation and warehousing, manufacturing and construction all adding jobs. The growth in the jobs market has continued even as the Fed has maintained its rates policy. The Fed said this week that inflation remained high and that it did not plan to cut interest rates until it has “greater confidence” that price increases are slowing to the goal of 2%. Jerome Powell, the Fed chair, said the slowdown in price increases was taking longer than expected, but that he expected inflation to “move back down” this year. Wage gains in April – which are also closely watched by the Fed – were also lower than forecast, increasing 3.9% from a year earlier after rising 4.1% in March. “Despite missing expectations, signaling an economic cooldown, the labor market has still maintained a pattern of growth and consumers can be cautiously optimistic that the Fed will be able to successfully lower inflation while also avoiding a recession,” said Steve Rick, chief economist at TruStage. ADP, the US’s largest payroll supplier, reported this week that private sector employment was up 192,000 jobs in the month of April and that annual pay was up 5% year-over-year. “Hiring was broad-based in April,” said Nela Richardson, chief economist at ADP. “Only the information sector – telecommunications, media, and information technology – showed weakness, posting job losses and the smallest pace of pay gains since August 2021.”",,2024-05-03 12:40:37+00:00,Business,https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/may/03/us-april-jobs-report,The Guardian
26,,"A water company that tried to keep secret details of hundreds of thousands of tonnes of raw sewage discharges into the sea has been ordered by an appeal tribunal to release the data in the public interest. Northumbrian Water has repeatedly refused to release details about the scale of raw sewage discharges into the North Sea from an outflow at its pumping station in Whitburn, after a campaigner asked under freedom of information and environmental information regulations. Campaigners say the pollution has been going on for years, but the Environment Agency, Northumbrian Water and the government all dispute their findings. In 2012 the European court of justice ruled the sewage discharges at Whitburn put the UK in breach of its legal obligations to treat wastewater and gave the government five years to remedy the situation.
Steve Lavelle, the vice-chair of the neighbourhood forum in Whitburn, south Tyneside, has been investigating the scale of raw sewage discharges in an attempt to show the pollution is continuing many years after the ECJ ruling. Lavelle said: “We need this information to show this pollution is still going on. We want the data to feed into our neighbourhood plan so that we can provide the details about the capacity of sewage treatment in the area when any future development is proposed. “At the moment they do not have the infrastructure in place to deal with the volume of sewage.” The Environment Agency permit for the plant states raw sewage discharges must only take place during intense rainfall or snowmelt. But data unearthed by Lavelle over many years has exposed what he says is sewage dumping outside periods of intense rainfall. In 2019 when the north-east of England received slightly above average rainfall of 750mm of rain, more than 760,000 tonnes of untreated sewage was discharged from Whitburn Steel pumping station directly into the North Sea, Environment Agency data obtained by Lavelle shows. In 2020, when rainfall was 610mm, within the annual average range, the long sea outfall discharged more than 460,000 tonnes of untreated sewage into the Northumbria Coast special protection area. A year later when rainfall was 660mm, the water company discharged a record high of 821,088 tonnes into the sea.
Lavelle said these discharges contributed to the pollution in the North Sea at Marsden, where there is a beach designated as bathing water, and the pollution to the beaches and rock pools at Whitburn. To retrieve 2022 data, he asked the water company via environmental information regulations and FoI to provide a detailed description of all of the sewage discharge records, the times of discharges and the volumes of sewage discharges. The regulator Ofwat and the Environment Agency are investigating more than 2,000 treatment works across the water network for suspected illegal sewage dumping. The investigations, which are likely to report this year, could impose significant fines or lead to the prosecution of some companies. Citing the investigations as a reason, Northumbrian Water refused to release the 2022 data to Lavelle, saying to do so “would adversely affect the course of justice, the ability of a person to receive a fair trial or the ability of a public authority to conduct an inquiry of a criminal or disciplinary nature”. When Lavelle asked for an internal review, Northumbrian Water argued that to release the sewage data could cause adverse public opinion to influence the regulators as they carried out their investigation. The Information Commissioner’s Office, asked to examine Lavelle’s request, supported the water company and said it was in the public interest for the company to keep the information secret. But after an appeal to the first tier tribunal, the panel found in favour of Lavelle and told the water company it was not satisfied that releasing the information would affect the course of justice.
The tribunal found it was in the public interest to release the information, and the water company had not adequately considered the need for transparency in its refusal to provide the information. “It has been like pulling teeth,” said Lavelle. “They are more intent on closing down my requests for information than being transparent and providing the information which is in the public interest.” Northumbrian Water said in a statement: “We are committed to protecting and enhancing coasts, rivers and watercourses in all areas of our operation and have proactively published a number of industry-leading pledges to generate further improvements. “We have a strong track record when it comes to the environment and have retained the excellent or good rating from the Environment Agency in each of the last three years. We note the tribunal court’s decision regarding the Whitburn pumping station and are considering our next steps.” The ruling came as seven water companies published near-real-time maps of their sewage discharges from combined sewer overflows, which was required under the Enviornment Act. Those companies are Dwr Cymru (Welsh Water), Yorkshire Water, Severn Trent, Northumbrian Water, Anglian Water, Wessex Water and United Utilities.",,2024-05-03 06:00:29+00:00,Business,https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/may/03/northumbrian-water-told-publish-raw-sewage-discharge-data,The Guardian
27,,"Joshua Dean, a Boeing whistleblower who warned of manufacturing defects in the planemaker’s 737 Max, has died after a short illness, the second Boeing whistleblower to die this year. Dean, 45, a former quality auditor at Boeing supplier Spirit AeroSystems, filed a complaint with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) alleging “serious and gross misconduct by senior quality management of the 737 production line” at Spirit. In 2018 and 2019, two 737 Max planes were involved in fatal crashes, which killed 346 people. Dean was fired by Spirit last year, and filed a complaint with the Department of Labor alleging that his termination was in retaliation for raising safety concerns. According to the Seattle Times, Dean was hospitalized after having trouble breathing. He was intubated and developed pneumonia and a serious infection before dying two weeks later. “He passed away yesterday morning, and his absence will be deeply felt. We will always love you Josh,” Dean’s aunt, Carol Dean Parsons, said via Facebook. Dean was represented by the same law firm that represented Boeing whistleblower John “Mitch” Barnett. Barnett, 62, was found dead in March from what appeared to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Barnett spent almost three decades at Boeing, and told the New York Times in 2019 that he had found “clusters or metal slivers” hanging over the wiring of flight controls that could have caused “catastrophic” damage if they had penetrated wires. He alleged that management had ignored his complaints and moved him to another part of the plant. Last month, another Boeing whistleblower, Sam Salehpour, told Congress there was “no safety culture” at Boeing, and alleged that employees who raised the alarm were “ignored, marginalized, threatened, sidelined and worse”. He said he feared “physical violence” after going public with his concerns. US regulators are now investigating Boeing after a mid-air door-panel blowout in January on a Boeing 737 Max 9. Reuters reported last month that the justice department is now weighing whether Boeing violated an agreement that shielded it from criminal prosecution over the fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019.

28,,"Paramount Global’s share price soared on Thursday following a report that Sony Pictures and Apollo Global Management had made a $26bn offer for the troubled media giant. According to the Wall Street Journal, the offer was made on Wednesday by Sony’s chief executive, Tony Vinciquerra, and Aaron Sobel, a partner at Apollo. Paramount’s shares rose 12% on the news. Paramount is home to some of the world’s biggest media assets including Paramount Pictures, CBS, MTV, the UK’S Channel 5 and Australia’s Channel Ten. The movie studio’s blockbuster hits include the Mission: Impossible franchise and The Godfather. But Paramount has struggled with the transition to streaming media and has been riven by internal power struggles. This week Bob Bakish, Paramount’s chief executive and one of the longest-serving media bosses in the US, was ousted amid reports that he had clashed with Shari Redstone, Paramount’s current controlling shareholder, over her plans to sell the company. Paramount has been considering a merger with Skydance Media, a production company led by David Ellison, the producer and son of Larry Ellison, the billionaire tech tycoon. Skydance has backed Paramount movies such as Top Gun: Maverick, but the deal has reportedly infuriated some shareholders who have argued it short-changes shareholders and is too generous to Redstone. Skydance has now increased the amount of money that could go toward Paramount’s balance sheet to $3bn, from $1.5bn. A combination of two of the most famous studios in Hollywood would attract the attention of the Biden administration which has recently displayed a more aggressive stance to big corporate mergers.

29,,"The Kremlin-owned gas company Gazprom has plunged to its first annual loss in more than 20 years, after gas sales more than halved following Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. The company made a net loss of 629bn roubles (£5.5bn) in 2023 amid dwindling gas trade with Europe, once Gazprom’s main sales market, as a result of sanctions and the throttling of pipelines to the continent. The results highlight the dramatic decline of the company, which since the collapse of the Soviet Union has been one of Russia’s most powerful, with its gas supplies often used as a leverage in disputes with neighbours such as Ukraine and Moldova. Analysts had expected net income of 447bn roubles, according to the Interfax news agency. According to analysis by Reuters, it was Gazprom’s first annual loss since the late 1990s/early 2000s, when Alexei Miller, an ally of the then newly installed President Putin, took over the company in 2001. Gazprom’s 2023 loss followed a net profit of 1.2tn roubles the previous year. The company, which is now headquartered in St Petersburg, made heavy losses in the late 1990s after it racked up foreign-currency debt, inflated in rouble terms by the financial crisis of 1998. Gazprom shares in Moscow were down about 4% on Thursday. Russia’s gas exports to Europe, once its primary export market, have slumped because of the political fallout from the conflict in Ukraine, while Gazprom, which has a monopoly on piping gas abroad, has been the most tangible victim of western sanctions. In mid-2022, Gazprom began throttling supplies of gas to Europe through its Nord Stream 1 pipeline, and that September announced it was indefinitely shutting down the conduit from Siberia into northern Germany via the Baltic Sea. The following month the pipeline was damaged by undersea explosions, the cause of which is still being looked into by German investigators. While the disruption pushed the whole gas price up to near-record highs, European countries had greater success than expected in finding alternative sources of supplies, with the US and Qatar helping to refill storage on the continent. Gazprom’s core profit, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda), fell to 618.38bn roubles last year, down from 2.79tn roubles in 2022, according to Reuters’ calculations. Ronald Smith from the Moscow-based brokerage BCS Global Markets said: “The full-year Ebitda of $7.2bn was the worst in 22 years, since the company reported $7.6bn in 2002.” According to Reuters’ calculations, Gazprom’s natural gas supplies to Europe fell 55.6% to 28.3bn cubic metres (bcm) last year. Gazprom has not published its own export statistics since the start of 2023. • Reuters contributed to this report.",,2024-05-02 17:23:09+00:00,Business,https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/may/02/gazprom-first-annual-loss-in-20-years-trade-europe-gas-sales-russia-ukraine,The Guardian

Gnodde said in the video that ending the UK cap would help level the playing field across its international workforce. “We are a global firm and to the extent possible we adopt a consistent global approach across everything we do. The bonus cap rules were an important factor preventing us from being consistent in the area of compensation.” He said Goldman had advocated for changes that would give banks the flexibility of weighting payouts more heavily towards bonuses rather than fixed salaries. The move gives lenders more control over staff pay, depending on performance. It will also be easier to defer pay, and potentially claw back bonuses from bankers when things go wrong. The changes will apply to hundreds of Goldman’s 6,000 UK staff – known as material risk takers – who will now be able to earn up to 25 times their salaries in bonuses. “Going forward, we will be aligning UK material risk takers’ compensation mix more closely with the firm’s global compensation principles – meaning lower fixed pay, but a higher proportion of discretionary compensation,” Gnodde said. “This also reflects the prudential objective of our regulators,” he added. The change will not apply to Goldman’s EU-based bankers, and unlike UK regulators, American watchdogs do not require any guidance on maximum payouts. The bonus cap was originally part of changes introduced after the 2007-08 banking crash, and aimed to stamp out a bonus culture blamed for encouraging short-term profits over longer-term stability. The hope was that, with less of an individual’s pay riding on performance, there would be a lower incentive for risky behaviour. However, they were opposed by some UK politicians as well as the Bank of England, who argued that the clampdown would make it harder to attract skilled bankers, who would instead flee to rival hubs in New York, Singapore or Zurich. The then chancellor, George Osborne, tried to overturn the measure at the European court of justice in 2014. Former chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng then took advantage of Britain’s exit from the EU, and announced plans to scrap the cap in September 2022. The changes were later approved by his successor, Jeremy Hunt, with regulators formalising the change in November last year. Goldman said in a statement: “This approach gives us greater flexibility to manage fixed costs through the cycle and pay for performance. It brings the UK closer to the practice in other global financial centres, to support the UK as an attractive venue for talent.”",,2024-05-02 15:36:29+00:00,Business,https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/may/02/goldman-sachs-uk-bankers-bonuses-cap-scrapped,The Guardian
31,", ","A surge in fraud cases in which photos are manipulated to show fake car crash damage is alarming insurers and helping to push motor insurance costs up to record levels. The insurer Allianz said incidents where apps were used to distort real-life images, videos and documents increased by 300% between 2021-22 and 2022-23, and it added that this had “all the signs of becoming the latest big scam to hit the insurance industry”. Rival insurer Zurich UK said it was also seeing more and more claims that had been doctored using so-called “shallowfake” technology, and that this was “becoming one of the most emerging threats from a counter-fraud point of view”. While deepfakes are hoax images, videos or documents typically created using AI, shallowfakes can be created using conventional editing software on a phone and apps such as Photoshop. Allianz, which includes the general insurance arm of LV=, said in one case an individual had a photo of his van posted on his social media page as part of his business and ended up having a claim pursued in his name for an accident that never took place. LV= received images of his vehicle from the fraudsters that seemed to show the front bumper had been cracked in the alleged accident, along with a fake repair invoice for more than £1,000. The LV= fraud team investigated and found the photo was identical to the one on the social media page, except for the fact that the image had been doctored to show the fake damage. Allianz said the rapidly changing nature of fraudulent activities such as shallowfake technology and the rise of deepfakes “pose big risks to UK consumers”. Scott Clayton, the head of claims fraud at Zurich UK, said recently that shallowfakes were most prevalent in motor insurance. He highlighted how fraudsters were using image editing software to add fake registration numbers to vehicles that had been written off. “We have seen an increase in people locating total loss vehicles on salvage agents’ websites and then implanting a registration number on to that car. There are then claims made for that vehicle, and a claims handler assessing this claim would take that at face value – that it is that actual vehicle,” Clayton said. Zurich said claims that had been completely manipulated using deepfake technology – often involving totally fake engineer reports and repair estimates – were also on the rise. Clayton said that in the past, criminals who intended to scam insurers with “crash-for-cash” claims needed to physically have vehicles crash into each other. “People can now create a fraudulent claim entirely from behind their computer and extract significant sums of money because these cars are total losses.” he added. Rising levels of fraud have been one of the factors contributing to higher motor insurance premiums. This week it emerged that the average price paid for comprehensive motor insurance in the UK was about a third (33%) – or £157 – higher in the first quarter of this year than in the same period in 2023. The data was issued by the Association of British Insurers.",,2024-05-02 14:17:40+00:00,Business,https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/may/02/car-insurance-scam-fake-damaged-added-photos-manipulated,The Guardian
32,,"A lack of skilled workers in the country is pushing up UK wages. The dearth of affordable housing has seen landlords put up rent by an average of 9% in a single year, weighing on inflation. New costs and controls at the border after Brexit are creating headaches for exporting companies. This cocktail of pressures on the UK economy has prompted analysts from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) to undercut the UK’s own national forecasts for growth. By 2025, the Paris-based thinktank says, UK growth will be below that of any advanced economy in the G7. The OECD has pencilled in a increase in gross domestic product of just 0.4% in 2024, a lower rate than any G7 member apart from Germany. By 2025, the UK slips to the back, with just 1% growth compared with an average of 1.5% in the eurozone. Up to now, the government could at least rely on Germany to own the title of sick man of Europe, after some updates to the national statistics showed the UK recovered more quickly from the pandemic and Brexit than was previously thought. The Treasury is a little more optimistic. Its April 2024 survey of independent forecasts showed an average of 0.5% for 2024 and 1.3% for 2025. The OECD verdict will come as a blow to Rishi Sunak and his chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, who claim the UK economy is improving, even though it slumped into a technical recession at the end of 2023. Hunt was quick to blame high interest rates for the OECD’s assessment, signposting statistics from the International Monetary Fund that showed the UK would grow faster than other advanced economies in the next six years. But all G7 countries have grappled with higher interest rates. While persistent inflation haunts many eurozone economies, making it harder for central banks to cut the cost of borrowing, other governments have taken a different approach to stimulating economic growth, particularly when it comes to business investment. Britain has consistently sat at the bottom of the OECD league tables for business investment. If UK business investment had matched the average of France, Germany and the US since 2008, Britain’s GDP would be nearly 4% higher today, improving wages by about £1,250 a year, analysis from the Resolution Foundation thinktank shows. The thinktank argues that rising foreign ownership of companies, alongside the lack of workers’ voices on boards, means the managers of UK companies are under less pressure to realise returns on investment when it comes. Giving workers a stake in a business creates greater engagement and personal investment in long-term profitability. The OECD outlook serves as an opportunity for the next government to offer more than just certainty about the direction of travel. If Labour is handed a mandate in the general election, it will need to bring to an end the uncertainty around border costs hitting UK exporters, increase apprenticeships to address the skills shortage, and change planning rules to get housebuilding on target. The party has outlined some ideas, but it will have to offer more detail on the industrial strategy it has promised in order to stimulate investment. An idea to create “technical excellence colleges” to address the skills shortage was light on details of what the status would bring. Meanwhile, the Sunak government is sticking to its mantra that the UK economy is getting stronger, despite figures suggesting it is still lagging behind. But moving back up the G7 rankings will require investment and fresh ideas.",,2024-05-02 14:03:35+00:00,Business,https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/may/02/oecd-forecasts-blow-to-sunak-and-hunt-claims-uk-economy-improving,The Guardian
33,,"Shell will shower its shareholders with another $3.5bn (£2.8bn) in share buybacks over the next quarter after reporting better than expected profits of almost $8bn for the first three months of the year. The company announced it would hand investors the multibillion-dollar payouts as it prepared to face a shareholder battle over its climate agenda at its annual general meeting later this month. Shell’s “staggering cashflows” resulted in adjusted earnings of $7.7bn for the first quarter, below the $9.6bn earned in the same quarter last year but still well above the $6.5bn predicted by analysts. Its chief executive, Wael Sawan, said the results released on Thursday had given the company the confidence to start another $3.5bn buyback programme for the next three months. Its shareholder payouts in the first quarter came to $5bn, of which $2.2bn was dividend payments and $2.8bn was share buybacks. The oil company, which handed investors $23bn in payouts last year, had one of its most profitable years on record in 2023 when it reported better than expected profits of more than $28bn for the year. Shell paid £1.1bn in overall tax in the UK for 2023, of which £240m was taxed under the government’s windfall tax, known as the Energy Profits Levy. Ed Miliband, Labour’s shadow energy and climate minister, said: “These results show yet again why it is so damning the Rishi Sunak refuses to bring in a proper windfall tax on the oil and gas giants. These are companies that have made record profits at the expense of working people. Labour says tax these companies fairly so we can invest in clean homegrown energy that will end the cost of living crisis and make Britain energy independent.”
Despite the payouts the oil company is coming under growing pressure from some shareholders to address its carbon emissions. A group including French asset manager Amundi, insurance giant Axa, and the UK government’s National Employment Savings Trust (Nest) have warned Shell that is not aligned with the Paris climate agreement. The company has been accused of watering down its green ambitions in an attempt to increase the company’s valuation by growing its liquified natural gas business and holding its oil production rates steady for the rest of the decade. Shell’s latest results showed overall oil and gas production rose by 3% in the quarter to 2.91m barrels of oil equivalent a day. The group of large European investors, coordinated by the campaign group Follow This, plans to bring a climate resolution to Shell’s AGM to push the company to do more to reduce its emissions. Mark van Baal, the founder of Follow This, said: “Large shareholders hold the key to tackling the climate crisis with their votes at shareholders’ meetings. Shell will only change if more shareholders vote for change. The resolution is designed to give Shell a shareholder mandate to drive the energy transition.” The company signalled this year that it could slow the pace of its emissions reductions for this decade by setting a new plan to reduce the carbon emissions intensity of the energy it sells by 15-20% by the end of the decade, compared with its previous target of 20%. The plan, combined with cost-cutting from its low-carbon business units, has helped to improve Shell’s share price relative to European rivals including BP. Shell’s share price reached a record high of just over £29 a share earlier this week, in part due to geopolitical upheavals of recent years that have supported higher gas and oil prices. But the company believes it could be worth more. Its former chief executive, Ben van Beurden, last month stoked fears that the oil company would quit the London Stock Exchange in favour of a New York listing because US investors were “more positive” about fossil fuels. Biraj Borkhataria, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said Shell made bigger operating cashflows for the first quarter than Exxon – after adjusting for working capital, and a similar spending budget – but still lagged behind its larger US rival in terms of market valuation. “The valuation disconnect continues to look extreme to us,” he said. The comments reignited concerns in the City over an exodus of London’s largest listed companies to rival exchanges. These concerns were compounded this week when shareholders of Flutter, the owner of Paddy Power, voted to move its primary listing to New York. It follows the Australian miner BHP’s unsolicited takeover bid for Anglo-American, which could mean the miner disappears from the London Stock Exchange.",,2024-05-02 07:23:49+00:00,Business,https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/may/02/shell-unveils-new-35bn-share-buy-back-after-higher-profits-than-expected,The Guardian

46,Eurozone factory activity takes a turn for the worse,"The latest economic data from the eurozone isn’t too cheering, either.

53,Novo Nordisk raises outlook fuelled by weight loss drug demand,"Novo Nordisk, the Danish pharmaceutical company behind the Wegovy weight loss drug, has beaten profit expectations as demand booms. Novo Nordisk’s sales increased by 22% in the first quarter, while operating profit rose by 27%. CEO Lars Fruergaard Jørgensen says: “We are pleased with the sales growth in the first three months of 2024, driven by increased demand for our GLP-1-based diabetes and obesity treatments,” Booming demand for Wegovy – which was made available in the UK last September – drove up Novo Nordisk’s share price to record levels and making it Europe’s most valuable company.
The company has lifted its forecasts for the year. It now expects sales growth this year of between 19% and 27% in local currencies, compared to the previously guided range for 18% to 26% growth. Operating profit growth this year is now seen at between 22% and 30% in local currencies, slightly up from its previous forecast of 21% to 29%. However, Novo’s share price has dipped by 1.5% this morning.",,2024-05-02 07:54:57+00:00,Business,https://www.theguardian.com/business/liveblog/2024/may/02/interest-rates-higher-for-longer-fed-bank-of-england-shell-profits-ftse-business-live,The Guardian
54,,"Strong sales of diabetes and weight loss drugs Ozempic and Wegovy have prompted the Danish pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk to raise its 2024 profit forecast to up to £15.3bn, with supply shortages starting to ease. Europe’s most valuable company, whose stock market value exceeds the size of the Danish economy, has struggled to keep up with runaway demand for the two weight-loss jabs. They have been endorsed by celebrities such as Oprah Winfrey and Elon Musk, although others such as the US comedian Amy Schumer have spoken of having to stop taking Ozempic because of the side-effects. Novo Nordisk made sales of 65bn Danish kroner (£7.5bn) in the first three months of the year, up 24% at constant exchange rates. This propelled pre-tax profits 29% higher to nearly 32bn kroner. The drugmaker is now expecting sales to grow between 19% and 27% this year, up from its previous estimate of between 18% and 26%. Operating profits are now forecast to increase between 22% and 30%, up from a previous estimate of 21% to 29%. Last year it made an operating profit of 102.6bn kroner. Novo’s chief executive, Lars Fruergaard Jørgensen, said 27,000 people were starting to use Wegovy injections for obesity every week in the US, up from 5,000 each week in December. The company is spending billions to expand its manufacturing capacity. The success of the drugs has resulted in “periodic supply constraints” and shortages. However, in January Novo Nordisk said it had doubled supply of “starter doses” for new Wegovy patients in the US after constraints forced it to restrict the release of the injections last May. Wegovy and Ozempic are part of a new class of weight-loss and diabetes drugs known as GLP-1, which are injected once a week and suppress people’s appetite. The GLP-1 agonist mimics the action of a hormone that is naturally released by the stomach when people eat food. They have helped some people lose significant amounts of weight but can cause unpleasant side-effects such as nausea. Novo Nordisk said higher sales volumes and competition with rival drugs had pushed down the price of Wegovy, leading to lower revenues than analysts had expected. However, this was offset by sales of Ozempic. Pressure is mounting on the company to reduce its prices further. Bernie Sanders, who chairs the US Senate health, education , labor and pensions committee, launched an investigation last week into “outrageously high prices” of Ozempic and Wegovy. He noted that Novo Nordisk charges $969 (£775) a month for Ozempic in the US, but just $155 in Canada and $59 in Germany. For Wegovy, the monthly cost is $1,349 in the US, $140 in Germany and $92 in the UK. Novo Nordisk’s main competitor, the US drugmaker Eli Lilly, raised its annual sales forecast by $2bn this week on the back of the success of its weight-loss injection Zepbound and its diabetes drug Mounjaro, which are also in short supply because of a surge in demand. The Indianapolis-based company’s market value has jumped to nearly $740bn, far ahead of Tesla and Walmart. Wegovy is available on the NHS and can also be bought privately at pharmacies. The list price for a month’s supply in the UK ranges from £73.25 to £175.80 depending on the dose. Russ Mould, the investment director at the stockbroker AJ Bell, said: “Competition is growing in the market but demand is so high that Novo Nordisk is still racing to keep up with supplies, not fretting about what a rival like Eli Lilly is doing. “However, the more products on the market and broader availability of each treatment, the greater the chance that prices will come down. This is already happening in the US. It means Novo Nordisk is facing the likelihood that weight-loss treatments become lower margin in time, hence why it needs to ramp up volumes as fast as possible as the dial shifts from earnings quality to earnings quantity.”",,2024-05-02 13:26:19+00:00,Business,https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/may/02/danish-firm-novo-nordisk-weight-loss-drug-wegovy-raises-profit-forecast,The Guardian
55,,"Barry McCarthy has stepped down as CEO of Peloton, the company said on Thursday, as it decided to cut 15% of its workforce to tackle a post-pandemic slump in demand for its connected fitness equipment. In a note, McCarthy said: “Hard as the decision has been to make additional headcount cuts, Peloton simply had no other way to bring its spending in line with its revenue.” McCarthy said Peloton was now “on the right path”. “You have a GREAT lead team, and although the stock market hasn’t recognized this yet, they will. It’s simply a matter of time,” he wrote. Shares of the beleaguered New York-based company rose as it announced it is also planning to cut back its retail presence, owing to weak demand that has forced Peloton to push back its goal of returning to profit. Karen Boone, Peloton’s chairperson, and Chris Bruzzo, Peloton’s director, will serve as interim co-CEOs. In addition, the company named director Jay Hoag as the chairperson of the board. The company’s board has started a search process to identify the next CEO. McCarthy will remain a Peloton adviser through the end of the year. The company’s sales had boomed during the pandemic as gyms closed and people tried to stay fit from home. Sales collapsed as the world reopened and McCarthy attempted to revamp Peloton as a subscription business and cut thousands of jobs. Once valued at over $50bn, the company is now worth $1.1bn. McCarthy is a former Netflix and Spotify executive and joined Peloton in February 2022, replacing co-founder John Foley. Under McCarthy, Peloton tried numerous tactics to revamp its business. The company ended its app’s free membership option, expanded into corporate wellness and brokered deals with brands including Lululemon and Hyatt hotels. As well as making big job cuts, Perloton has taken several other cost-cut measures such as changing bike prices, offering its products through third-party retailers and focusing on digital subscription plans. But the losses have continued to mount. Peloton has not made a net profit since December 2020. On Thursday the company announced that revenues had fallen again in the last quarter, its ninth consecutive quarter of declining revenues. Peloton said on Thursday it expects connected fitness members for the full year to be between 2.96 million and 2.98 million, lower by 30,000 members from prior forecast. “Peloton has discovered that fitness trends come and go and staying ahead of the curve is incredibly difficult,” Zak Stambor, senior analyst, retail and ecommerce at research firm Insider Intelligence said. For the three months ending on 31 March, Peloton lost $167.3m, down from $275.9m for the same quarter last year. Peloton shares jumped 11% in early trading.

56,,"Dollar General investors are pushing for shareholders to vote against executive officer compensation proposals at the company that raise “serious concerns regarding Dollar General’s governance, corporate priorities, and treatment of its workforce”. In a letter to shareholders the SOC Investment Group, formerly known as the Change to Win Federation, pointed out that the median salary for a Dollar General employee in 2023 was $18,657 annually, or over $9 an hour, while Dollar General’s CEO, Todd Vasos, received nearly $183m in compensation from 2015 to 2021. SOC is calling on investors to vote no on a “Say on Pay” resolution at the company’s annual shareholder meeting on 29 May that includes a rehire stock option package for the CEO, hefty severance agreements for executives and a substantial allowance for the CEO’s personal use of the corporate jet. Vasos served as CEO of the company from June 2015 to November 2022, when he became a senior adviser to the company before retiring in April 2023. A few months later in October 2023, Vasos returned as CEO of the company. His compensation for 2024 totals about $9.7m, but also includes several perks that could yield him substantially more through stock options. “Our critiques on the pay package are twofold,” said Tejal Patel, the executive director of the SOC Investment Group. “It’s the way they’re granting it because it’s tied to options and this new term that they sort of created called ‘rehire options’ that we’ve never really heard of before.” Patel noted the structure poses significant transparency issues, in addition to the stock options awarded by the board not being tied to performance and the exercise price for the options being set at a much lower share price than that at which the company’s stock is typically traded. Also included in the CEO’s proposed pay package is $500,000 in reimbursement for personal use of Dollar General’s corporate jet. “The company’s own peer group doesn’t even offer perks of this level,” added Patel. “I would say unusual and large perk packages can be indicative of larger problems with the executive compensation program design.” The investment group is also urging shareholders to vote no on the company’s “Say on Pay” proposal due to the severance agreements for executives, which, Patel argues, basically guarantee severance will be paid. Patel noted the terms of the agreement make it difficult to calculate the exact amount of the severance packages.
“What that means is the company is effectively committing to paying these executives increasingly higher salaries either through renewing the employee agreement or through the severance if they don’t renew the agreement,” said Patel. “I think it’s important to point out the discrepancy between what the company is paying these executives to stop working at Dollar General versus what they’re paying their employees.” The letter urging shareholders to vote down Dollar General’s executive pay proposal cited that the cash severance payment to the departing CEO Jeffery Owen in 2023 was $5,625,000, the equivalent of the company’s median annual pay for more than 300 employees. In 2023, investors successfully pushed for an independent third-party audit at Dollar General on worker safety given the company being placed on Occupational Safety and Health Administration’s severe violator program due to numerous safety violations and fines at stores across the US. “It’s the company’s responsibility to basically make sure the pay packages for their leadership team are aligned with better performance overall, and that includes better oversight of their workforce and making sure they are addressing the poor working conditions in a concrete manner,” concluded Patel. Dollar General did not respond to multiple requests for comment on the effort for shareholders to vote down the company’s executive pay packages.",,2024-05-02 11:00:05+00:00,Business,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/may/02/dollar-general-ceo-pay,The Guardian
57,,"More than 10,500 of London’s black-cab drivers have launched a £250m legal case against Uber, accusing it of breaking the capital’s taxi booking rules and deliberately misleading authorities to secure a licence. The case, which has been filed in the high court in London by the litigation management firm RGL, resurrects a claim first raised five years ago, related to the way the ride-hailing app operated in London between 2012 and 2018. Cabbies allege that Uber allowed drivers to take bookings directly from customers rather than through a centralised system such as those used by minicab services, in a direct breach of private hire rules. They allege Uber was aware of the rules and deliberately misled Transport for London (TfL) about its booking model in order to obtain an operating licence and take business from black-cab drivers. Uber has denied the allegations and says the claim is unfounded. The drivers, who are being advised by the law firm Mishcon de Reya, argue in their suit that they faced unfair competition, and lost out on customers and income, as a result. Garry White, a black-cab driver of 36 years, said: “This claim seeks justice and fair compensation on behalf of cab drivers across London. Uber seems to believe it is above the law and cabbies across London have suffered loss of earnings because of it. It is time they were held to account.” RGL said that if the cabbies were successful in their claim they could secure more than £250m, with individuals potentially winning £25,000 or more. An Uber spokesperson said: “These old claims are completely unfounded. Uber operates lawfully in London, is fully licensed by TfL, and is proud to serve millions of passengers and drivers across the capital.” It marks the latest bout of legal trouble for Uber. In March, the San Francisco-based company reached an A$272m settlement (£142m) to compensate taxi and hire-car drivers who said they lost out when the company “aggressively” moved into the Australian market. That class action, which was launched five years ago, was filed on behalf of 8,000 taxi and hire-car owners and drivers, who argued that Uber X launched in Australia with the intention of hurting their business. The suit also alleged that the company used unlicensed cars with unaccredited drivers in a “conspiracy by unlawful means” and misled regulators. Dale Forwood, a black-cab driver of 12 years, said he hoped the London case would bring justice for local cabbies. “I am delighted to see this claim being filed today and that we will finally have our day in court,” he said. “Having seen for myself the harm that Uber’s unlawful behaviour has caused to hard-working cabbies, I look forward to justice being served.”",,2024-05-02 10:53:56+00:00,Business,https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/may/02/london-black-cab-drivers-uber-lawsuit,The Guardian
58,,"For Javier Torres and other workers whose jobs are conducted outdoors in south Florida, the heat is unavoidable. A new law recently signed by Ron DeSantis, Florida’s Republican governor, that prohibits any municipalities in the state from passing heat protections for workers ensures that it is likely to stay that way. Torres has seen a co-worker die from heatstroke and another rushed to the emergency room in his years of working in construction in south Florida. He has also fallen and injured himself due to heat exhaustion.
“I work outdoors and have no choice but to work in the heat. I work often in painting and, in the majority of cases, we’re exposed to direct sun and we don’t have shade. Sometimes I feel dizzy and get headaches,” said Torres. He said employers rarely provide workers with water, leaving workers to ensure they bring enough water to work or find a hose to drink from. The effects of extreme heat on workers are only expected to worsen due to the climate crisis. Many parts of Florida experienced record heat last year. Orlando hit 100F (37.7C) in August breaking a record set in 1938. The National Weather Service recently issued its outlook for summer 2024, predicting Florida summer temperatures will be warmer than normal. “The heat can be very intense, especially as we get closer to summer,” added Torres. “What we want as workers who labor outdoors is to have water, shade and rest breaks to protect ourselves.” At the behest of agricultural industry lobbyists, DeSantis signed HB433 into law on 11 April, a bill scaling back child labor protections that also included an amendment prohibiting all local municipalities in Florida from enacting heat protections for workers. The exemption came in response to efforts by farm workers in Miami-Dade county to pass heat protections, including proper rest breaks, access to water and shade, as increasingly warming temperatures have expanded the days farm workers are exposed to heat. Ana Mejia, a farm worker, worked for 11 years at Costa Farms in south Florida where she said she experienced two serious heat stress incidents on the job. Costa Farms was included on the National Council for Occupational Safety and Health’s Dirty Dozen report of unsafe employers in 2024. Costa Farms declined to comment. “I worked outdoors during my entire time at Costa Farms in temperatures that quite often exceeded 100 degrees,” said Mejia. “I had headaches, sweat excessively, my body would start to shake and tremble. I started to feel dizzy and a lack of coordination, and this feeling of shock and desperation. It was a very bad experience.” She recounted having to be brought to onsite medical care, but only being given an electrolyte drink and finding no medical professional on site or called to help her. “The high standards of meeting productivity quotas per day combined with working in high temperatures is putting us in danger,” added Mejia. “The rest breaks are at the discretion of supervisors and often they don’t want to give rest breaks because it will reduce the productivity of the business.” There are currently no protections in the US for workers from heat. Only a handful of states such as California, Washington, Oregon, Colorado and Minnesota have passed any heat protections for workers. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (Osha) is currently reviewing federal heat standard protections and issues fines against employers citing the general duty clause in cases where workers die due to heat stress, but worker groups have advocated that heat protections which include water, rest, shade, breaks and acclimatization are needed to save workers from heat illnesses and their lives. Up to 2,000 workers in the US die every year due to heat stress, according to a 2023 report by Public Citizen. Several business groups are lobbying against heat protections for workers at the federal level, and lobbyists aggressively pushed lawmakers to pass the Florida heat exemption bill. Orlando Weekly reported on texts from corporate lobbyists to lawmakers urging them to pass the heat exemption bill before the end of the legislative session. “I haven’t texted you in weeks–HEAT cannot die,” wrote Carol Bowen, a lobbyist for the Associated Builders and Contractors in a text message on 7 March to the House speaker Paul Renner’s chief of staff Allison Carter, the day before the last day of the legislative session when the bill was ultimately passed. “The entire business community is in lock step on this. Thank you for your attention to this concern.” Ahead of a vote on the bill, the Florida chamber of commerce lobbyist Carolyn Johnson told Republican lawmakers their vote on the bill would be double-weighted on the How They Voted report the chamber sends to its members. Jeannie Economos, an organizer with the Farmworker Association of Florida, said worker advocacy groups opposing HB433 were hoping the clock would run out for the bill to get passed by the state legislature. Several labor and environmental groups sent letters imploring DeSantis to veto the bill. “It’s incomprehensible that people who live in Florida, and are supposed to represent the people of Florida, can vote against the health and safety of the workers that make this economy run, who were considered essential workers just a couple years ago and given PPE, are now treated like this, and not giving protection from extreme heat,” said Economos. “That makes no sense and it’s unconscionable.” She said worker advocacy groups in Florida were regrouping and planned on developing strategies on how to override the Florida law, while continuing to advocate for heat protections at the federal level and conducting heat stress trainings for outdoor workers to protect themselves. “For us right now, while HB433 is a setback to our campaign, we know the issue of extreme heat isn’t going away anytime soon,” said Oscar Londoño, executive director of the worker advocacy non-profit WeCount!, which has been pushing for heat protections for workers through its ¡Qué Calor! campaign. “We know that the issue is going to get even more and more relevant, and that workers will need to continue to do what is necessary to protect their lives on a job, whether that is through direct action, through workplace organizing, or through ongoing corporate campaign, workers will find a way to win the protection they deserve in Florida.”",,2024-05-04 13:00:40+00:00,Environment,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/may/04/florida-worker-heat-water-protection,The Guardian
59,,"Bumblebee nests may be overheating, killing off broods and placing one of the Earth’s critical pollinators in decline as temperatures rise, new research has found. Around the world, many species of Bombus, or bumblebee, have suffered population declines due to global heating, the research said. Bumblebee colonies are known for their ability to thermoregulate: in hot conditions, worker bees gather to beat their wings and fan the hive, cooling it down. But as the climate crisis pushes average temperatures up and generates heatwaves, bumblebees will struggle to keep their homes habitable. Most bumblebee broods would not survive at temperatures above 36C, the paper, published in Frontiers in Bee Science, concluded. The research team reviewed 180 years of literature, and found that for all bumblebee species studied the optimum temperature range for incubating nests was between 28C and 32C. Peter Kevan, the lead author of the study, told the Guardian: “If [bumblebees] can’t keep temperatures below what is probably a lethal limit of about 35C, when the brood may die, that could explain why we are losing so many bumblebees around the world, especially in North America and Europe.”
Kevan, who is a professor emeritus at the University of Guelph’s School of Environmental Sciences in Canada, added that the research examined the often-overlooked role of the nest as a “superorganism”. “Researchers have been looking at foraging behaviour and fanning to keep the brood cool, but there are very few studies that look at the whole nest,” he said. The study argued that nests should be seen as a whole: while some individual bees may be able to cope with heat, if the nest becomes too hot to raise healthy larvae the whole colony will decline. Dave Goulson, a professor of biology at the University of Sussex, who was not involved in the research, said: “We have known for a long time that bumblebees are cool-climate specialists. Most insects are more abundant in the tropics, but bumblebees are weird in that they are at their most abundant in places like the Alps and Britain.” They are big and furry as an adaptation to living in cooler places, he said. “There are even some that live in the Arctic, the Bombus polaris. That means an obvious problem with climate change – they are vulnerable to warming.” When nests overheat, he added, bumblebees work to cool them by flapping their wings, “but if the air outside is too hot, that’s not going to help”. Goulson said there is already evidence that bumblebees have started to disappear from the warmer edges of their range. “There have been publications showing mountain bumblebees are moving higher as a way to combat warming, but obviously there is a limit to that.”
The paper’s findings, said Goulson, who has spent 30 years studying bumblebees, are “really depressing”. “It is kind of heartbreaking to think that many may disappear.” Other studies, he said, suggest that the UK “might lose about half our bumblebee species in coming years, depending on the pace of climate change”. Their populations had been declining due to habitat loss, Goulson said. “Now, [with rising temperatures] we have a double whammy.”
Richard Comont, the science manager at Britain’s Bumblebee Conservation Trust, also not part of the study, said he was glad to see the new research. “It’s something that there has been speculation about for a while,” he said. Bumblebees are important pollinators of wild flowers and crops including tomatoes, runner beans, apples, blueberries, blackcurrants and raspberries. For other pollinators, Goulson said, the outlook under a hotter climate is less clear. Some bee species can cope with warmer temperatures, and some species that now live farther south may move north as temperatures rise, making a new home in the UK. With other pollinators, he said, such as flies, wasps, butterflies, birds and bats, “it’s hard to generalise”. To stem declines, increasing habitats and decreasing pesticide use could help, Goulson said – but really, “we need to knuckle down” and make sure global temperatures “do not go past 2C” of heating.

60,,"Gardeners are inadvertently killing scores of earthworms with soil conditioners marketed as “organic”, experts fear, as they call for tighter regulation on products that poison the invertebrates. Earthworms may appear humble, but Charles Darwin thought their work in improving soil structure and fertility was so important he devoted his final book to them and said: “It may be doubted if there are any other animals which have played such an important part in the history of the world as these lowly organised creatures.” However, some gardeners who want a tidy lawn remove worm casts, which can be viewed as unsightly, particularly if the casts – made of the worms’ excrement – are squashed and spread over the surface. Dozens of products available to gardeners and greenkeepers say they combat these casts, reducing the time-consuming task of their manual removal. However, most contain saponins, which have been found to be highly toxic to earthworms. Some of these are marketed as “organic soil conditioner” with no mention of the deadly effect they have on worms. Others promise to “irritate and deter” worms, pushing them to deeper soil – not mentioning the active ingredient that could kill them. Despite their potential toxicity to garden creatures, soil conditioners do not go through the same rigorous risk assessments as pesticides, experts say, and are lightly regulated.
Worms ingest dead plant material and break it down into nutrients, and healthy soil is important for a thriving garden and the wider ecosystem. The Royal Horticultural Society points out that casts are good for the soil and can be used as a nutrient-rich potting medium, and it discourages their removal. Worms are thought to be under threat: though studies into their populations are scarce, recent research suggests numbers in the UK may have fallen by about a third in the past 25 years. Prof Dave Goulson, a biologist at the University of Sussex, has written extensively on gardening in symbiosis with invertebrates, and has been investigating the soil products. He told the Guardian: “Dozens of products are being sold to gardeners and groundskeepers, especially [at] golf courses, to combat worm casts. Many contain saponins, found in one scientific study to be ‘highly toxic’ to earthworms. “The products are widely marketed online, with some bulk products obviously aimed at professional greenkeepers, other smaller bottles aimed at gardeners. The saponin usually seems to derive from ‘tea seed’, so is an organic product, but that doesn’t mean it is harmless: botulinum toxin and cyanide are organic. Groundskeepers should not be allowed to poison earthworms while pretending to ‘condition’ the soil. It seems to be pesticides by stealth.”
Campaigners are calling for the government to investigate these products, suspending their use until their effect on earthworms and other wildlife is fully understood. Nick Mole, a policy officer at Pesticide Action UK, said: “Fertilisers and soil conditioners aren’t subject to anywhere near the same level of scrutiny as pesticides. They don’t appear to go through a risk assessment process to ascertain if they are harmful to non-target species such as earthworms, which is highly concerning given how widely they are used. “Any substance that is intentionally released into the natural environment has the potential to cause harm, even those labelled as organic. Now that the alarm bells have been sounded the UK government must act quickly to suspend use of these products while they investigate further, including conducting thorough risk assessments looking at the impact of these products on earthworms and other wildlife, including aquatic species. Or will the government sit on its hands for another 10 years, as it did with neonicotinoids and bees?” A Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs spokesperson said: “Decisions on the use of pesticides are based on careful scientific assessment of the risks. Pesticides are only allowed on to the market if they meet strict environmental requirements and pose no threat to human health.”",,2024-05-04 07:00:34+00:00,Environment,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/may/04/pesticides-by-stealth-garden-soil-conditioners-killing-worms-experts-fear,The Guardian
61,,"The ambush was simple. A spotter on a hill would scan the sea and when he saw the big black fins approach, he would shout down to the boatmen. They would ready their nets and quickly row out to the kill zone. When a shark got tangled in the mesh, Brian McNeill would wait a minute or two while it struggled, then steady himself and raise his harpoon. This was the crucial moment. The creature would be diving and thrashing, desperate to escape. If the blade hit the gills blood would spurt, clouding the water. The trick was to hit a small spot between the vertebrae. “It was very hard to get him exactly in the vertebrae,” McNeill recalls. “He’d be spinning and diving all the time. If you happened to get the spear in that inch and a half, that was him. His eyes would roll back in his head and he wouldn’t move again.” And so another basking shark would die off Achill, a County Mayo island on Ireland’s Atlantic coast that was a gathering point – and then a graveyard – for a mysterious, majestic species.
The slaughter in Keem Bay began in the 1950s when islanders discovered there was money in the livers and fins of the plankton-eating visitors, which arrived in spring and left in summer. Crews in currachs, traditional wooden boats, greeted them with nets and harpoons. Some seasons more than 1,500 carcasses littered the island’s beaches and jetties. Over the years the visitors became fewer and the catch dwindled to a few hundred, then a few dozen and by the 1980s just a handful every season.
In 1984 only five were caught, after which hunting was abandoned. McNeill was part of the crew that caught the last shark. After that, sightings became very rare. Whatever sharks were left, they seemed to forsake Achill. “The sharks disappeared,” says McNeill. Now aged 76, he is one of the last living connections to the hunting era – and a witness to an unexpected coda: the sharks are back.
Sightings of Cetorhinus maximus, the world’s second-biggest fish after whale sharks, have proliferated in Achill and other parts of the coastline of Ireland and Britain in recent years. The phenomenon has intrigued and delighted researchers, given that the species is classed internationally as endangered and facing a high risk of extinction, according to the Irish government. “It’s astounding,” says Alex McInturf, a coordinator for the Irish Basking Shark Group, an international team of scientists. While sightings in New Zealand and the north-west US have declined, they have surged in Ireland and Scotland. “They are one of the only locations where you can see basking sharks regularly and in large numbers,” she says. “The crazy part is that the fishery in Ireland used to be the biggest in the world yet Ireland seems to be the place where they have recovered the most. You would have expected the opposite.”
Despite their size – up to 10 metres long – the sharks are hard to count and track, says McInturf, a postdoctoral fellow at Oregon State University’s Big Fish Lab and a visiting researcher at Queen’s University Belfast. In some seasons, dozens are spotted; in other years its hundreds, she says. “We don’t know what’s driving those variations, we’re trying to figure that out.” One theory concerns connectivity between Irish and Scottish waters. Sharks have been filmed circling each other in tight formations, prompting speculation of courtship rituals. In 2022 Ireland extended legal protection by making it an offence to hunt, injure or wilfully interfere with basking sharks’ breeding or resting places, a move long sought by campaigners. The UK has similar legislation. McNeil blames the visitors’ long absence on offshore salmon trawlers inadvertently snagging the sharks in drift nets, a practice that was made illegal in 2007. Whatever has brought the creatures back, McNeill shares the delight of islanders and tourists, who flock to beaches to savour the spectacle. “I’m happy they’ve made a comeback,” he says. He does not, however, regret hunting them.
Originally from County Monaghan, McNeill worked as a chef in London before moving with his wife to Achill in 1971. “I just got tired of the tube and the crowds.” He joined a four-strong team on a currach that fished salmon and sharks. “They were such enormous fish and they were really quiet until they went into the net.” Sometimes they escaped the trap. “If they were big and strong they could bust through the net, no problem.” He estimates he killed up to 300, using harpoons they made from a car chassis, but admits he felt some sympathy for them. “They were doing no harm to anybody,” he says.
But he had no compunction during a hunt, when a boat risked being overturned by the huge fish. “You’re only thinking about getting rid of the danger as quickly as possible. “I was happy that they were dead so we were out of harm’s way,” he says. “It was self-preservation.”
Livers were turned into oil and the fins sold as delicacies to countries in Asia, yielding income that let fishers and their families on the borderline of poverty stay on Achill rather than emigrate, says McNeill. “Everybody had money and it was a good life.” He looks forward to calm, sunny days, ideal conditions for shark-spotting from his home in Dooagh village, which overlooks another bay. “It’s lovely to see them. I’m just happy that we’re not killing them any more.”",,2024-05-04 06:00:32+00:00,Environment,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/may/04/ireland-achill-mayo-last-basking-shark-hunter-return-of-giant-fish,The Guardian
62,,"Sounds of ringing picks and hammers, clattering rockfalls, squealing railway wagon wheels on iron tracks: a cacophony that, a century ago, carried on the wind into the centre of the town, a mile downhill. Then, Ashes quarry employed 200 men who sent 136,000 tonnes of limestone annually to the Consett iron and steelworks, 10 miles distant across bleak Pennine moorland. This morning, silence, broken only by metallic tchak-tchak calls of jackdaws, echoing from the vertical rock face. Nature has reclaimed this chasm in the fellside, transforming it into a shallow lake.
Standing on a spoil heap near the water’s edge, sheltered by a towering cliff from an icy north-westerly wind, I can smell peaty fragrance from sun-warmed moss, wild thyme crushed underfoot and a lacustrine aroma of last autumn’s decaying reedmace leaves. At the water margin, its brown, felty, cylindrical seedheads – seemingly out of synchrony with spring’s new growth – are disintegrating, dispersing wisps of plumed seeds across the water. A blue tit arrives and begins pecking one apart. Searching for insects or collecting material for a comfy nest lining? The latter, it seems; it carries a beak-load away to a nest hole in the cliff, whereupon a mysterious dark shape – blunt-headed and broad-winged – detaches from a ledge, glides away and disappears among deep shadows along the rock wall. Following is difficult: too much haste over this jagged, slippery rock invites a broken ankle. Stepping carefully, looking down for footholds, risking brief upward glances, I thought I knew where it went, but can see no sign, so I stand, wait and watch. Nothing, no movement, no sound.
Just as I’m about to leave, through the branches of a tree growing from a fissure in the cliff comes the revelation that I am being watched by the unblinking gaze of a tawny owl, eyes like polished jet. It’s perched inside a small cave created by fallen rock, lit by the rising sun. Disdainful of the clumsy animal down below, it decides that I’m no threat, and its heavy-lidded eyes close. We inhabit separate worlds: the snoozing owl belongs to the moon and stars; my day, with overnight frost still melting on the grass, is just beginning. • Country diary is on Twitter at @gdncountrydiary",,2024-05-01 04:30:46+00:00,Environment,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/may/01/country-diary-i-am-it-turns-out-being-watched,The Guardian
63,. ,"Using a gas stove increases nitrogen dioxide exposure to levels that exceed public health recommendations, a new study shows. The report, published Friday in Science Advances, found that people of color and low-income residents in the US were disproportionately affected. Indoor gas and propane appliances raise average concentrations of the harmful pollutant, also known as NO2, to 75% of the World Health Organization’s standard for indoor and outdoor exposure. That means even if a person avoids exposure to nitrogen dioxide from traffic exhaust, power plants, or other sources, by cooking with a gas stove they will have already breathed in three-quarters of what is considered a safe limit. “When you’re using a gas stove, you are burning fossil fuel directly in the home,” said Yannai Kashtan, lead author of the study and a PhD candidate at Stanford University. “Ventilation does help but it’s an imperfect solution and ultimately the best way is to reduce pollution at the source.” Nitrogen dioxide irritates the airways and can exacerbate respiratory illnesses such as asthma. The Stanford study estimates that chronic stove-based nitrogen dioxide exposure is linked to at least 50,000 cases of pediatric asthma in the United States each year. The research, which measured NO2 in more than 100 homes before, during, and after gas stove use, found that pollution migrates to bedrooms within an hour of the stove turning on, and stays above dangerous levels for hours after use. “It’s moving throughout our whole home much faster than we expected,” said Rob Jackson, professor of Earth system science at Stanford and co-author of the study. “You have to think about the effects of this not just in one cooking event, but multiple times a day, for lunch and dinner, across weeks and months.” Roughly 38% of households in the US use gas stoves, according to the Energy Information Administration, but not all of them are exposed to NO2 equally. The study suggests that size of the home is an important factor, with people living in residences less than 800 sq ft showing chronic exposure four times the rate of people living in homes with 3,000 sq ft. “Older homes are more likely to be smaller, and more often have gas stoves which reflects the nature of our housing stock,” said Jon Samet, professor of environmental and occupational health at the Colorado School of Public Health, who was not involved in the study. “It’s good to see this work focusing attention on indoor air, particularly in our homes, because that’s where we spend most of our time.” The results also highlight the unequal racial and socioeconomic burden of exposure. The study found that American Indians and Alaska Natives are exposed to 60% more NO2 from gas and propane stoves than the national average. Black and Latino or Hispanic households breathe in 20% more NO2 from their stoves. People in households making less than $10,000 a year are breathing NO2 at rates more than twice that of people in households making over $150,000. “People in poorer communities are more at risk because their outdoor air is bad and and in many ways their indoor air is worse,” said Jackson. Low-income communities and communities of color are more likely to live near highways, ports, industrial sites and other polluting zones. While this study looked at stovetop pollution from cooking, which is a relatively short period of exposure, some people who struggle to afford utility bills rely on stoves and ovens for heat during colder months. “There’s an underlying assumption that people are only using their stove or oven to cook and to prepare meals,” said Diana Hernandez, sociologist at Columbia University who was not involved in the Stanford study. A recent survey conducted by Hernandez and her team found that over 20% of New Yorkers used stoves or ovens to heat their homes. “That’s a less efficient and much more toxic way of providing heat, and more costly,” Hernandez said. “You’re talking about heating an entire home, or apartment, probably for hours on end, with a device and appliance that wasn’t meant for that.” Gas stoves also emit methane, a potent greenhouse gas, and cities across the US are adopting building electrification measures that would phase out gas stoves in new homes. Dorris Bishop, a resident of River Terrace neighborhood in Washington DC, said she recently joined a waitlist to trade her gas stove in for an electric appliance after a local advocacy group tested her home for NO2 and found elevated levels. “I’m hopeful that this report will push for all of the new homes to put electric stoves in,” she said.",,2024-05-03 18:13:20+00:00,Environment,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/may/03/gas-stoves-nitrogen-dioxide-pollution,The Guardian
64,,"Once upon a time, an unkempt front lawn could have landed you in trouble with the neighbours. But now, councils are telling UK households to put away their lawnmower for No Mow May. The one-month celebration of unmown gardens and parks was started in 2019 by the nature charity Plantlife, which encourages people to let grass and wildflowers grow and identify any interesting plants that spring up from the lawn. The charity says 40 local councils have signed up to leave some of their verges and parks to grow. This not only provides space for rare wildflowers but also gives habitat and food to birds and invertebrates. Andrew Doyle, the conservation officer for road verges and green spaces at Plantlife, said: “Experiencing the biodiversity benefits and cost savings a magical month of No Mow May brings in is a glorious gateway for councils to pass through en route to the more long-term wildlife-friendly grasslands green space management our wild plants and fungi – and the ecosystems that depend on them – need to thrive, benefiting the local community and climate.” Wandsworth council in south London is leaving 20 designated sites unmown and recommending local households do the same with their gardens. Councillors have said private domestic gardens cover 716 hectares (1,770 acres) in Wandsworth, almost 20% of the borough’s total area. Bradford council is letting 85 green spaces go unmown around the area. A Bradford council spokesperson said: “We are looking to implement ‘no mow’ on some of our sites to sustain biodiverse area and natural preservation. We all need to do what we can to create a more sustainable district for the future.” Councillors on the Isle of Wight say its natural heritage is an important facet of the island’s Unesco status, so protecting it by doing No Mow May makes sense. Natasha Dix, the council’s service director for waste environment and planning, said: “Encouraging biodiversity holds significant importance for our environment. The presence of wild orchids, including the declining man orchid, green-winged orchid, southern marsh orchid, northern marsh orchid and bee orchid can brighten up liberated lawns and enhance our natural spaces.
“The urgency lies in the threat to the world’s bee population. By allowing lawns to bloom, even for just a month, we actively support our local bees and contribute to the broader biodiversity structures that play a critical role in maintaining balance. I encourage everyone to participate in this meaningful endeavour. Let’s unleash the power of wildflowers.” Warwick council is also participating. A councillor, Will Roberts, said: “Nature isn’t neat, but it’s a big part of where we live. Beneath the long grass, wildflowers and what might be viewed as ‘weeds’ lies a thriving habitat of vital species that will help us combat the negative effects of climate change, delivering multiple benefits for wildlife and people.” Ian Dunn, the chief executive of Plantlife, said: “Support for Plantlife’s campaign is blossoming beautifully as people recognise the benefits to plants, people, pollinators and planet of mowing less and later for nature. The small act of giving the mower a month off, and then mowing less through the summer, can make a big difference at a time when we face interlinked climate and biodiversity emergencies.”",,2024-05-03 13:38:48+00:00,Environment,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/may/03/no-mow-may-councils-urge-britons-put-away-lawnmowers,The Guardian
65,,"The UK government’s climate action plan is unlawful, the high court has ruled, as there is not enough evidence that there are sufficient policies in place to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The energy secretary, Claire Coutinho, will now be expected to draw up a revised plan within 12 months. This must ensure that the UK achieves its legally binding carbon budgets and its pledge to cut emissions by more than two-thirds by 2030, both of which the government is off track to meet. The environmental charities Friends of the Earth and ClientEarth took joint legal action with the Good Law Project against the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ) over its decision to approve the carbon budget delivery plan (CBDP) in March 2023. In a ruling on Friday, Mr Justice Sheldon upheld four of the five grounds of the groups’ legal challenge, stating that the decision by the former energy security and net zero secretary Grant Shapps was “simply not justified by the evidence”. He said: “If, as I have found, the secretary of state did make his decision on the assumption that each of the proposals and policies would be delivered in full, then the secretary of state’s decision was taken on the basis of a mistaken understanding of the true factual position.” The judge agreed with ClientEarth and Friends of the Earth that the secretary of state was given “incomplete” information about the likelihood that proposed policies would achieve their intended emissions cuts. This breached section 13 of the Climate Change Act, which requires the secretary of state to adopt plans and proposals that they consider will enable upcoming carbon budgets to be delivered. Sheldon also agreed with the environment groups that the central assumption that all the department’s policies would achieve 100% of their intended emissions cuts was wrong. The judge said the secretary of state had acted irrationally, and on the basis of an incorrect understanding of the facts. This comes after the Guardian revealed the government would be allowing oil and gas drilling under offshore wind turbines, a decision criticised by climate experts as “deeply irresponsible”. The CBDP outlines how the UK will achieve targets set out in the sixth carbon budget, which runs until 2037, as part of wider efforts to reach net zero by 2050. Those emissions targets were set after a 2022 ruling that Britain had breached legislation designed to help reach the 2015 Paris agreement goal of containing temperatures within 1.5C (2.7F) of pre-industrial levels. The Climate Change Committee’s assessment last year was that the government only had credible policies in place for less than 20% of the emissions cuts needed to meet the sixth carbon budget. The lawyer for Friends of the Earth, Katie de Kauwe, said: “This is another embarrassing defeat for the government and its reckless and inadequate climate plans. We’ve all been badly let down by a government that’s failed, not once but twice, to deliver a climate plan that ensures both our legally binding national targets and our international commitment to cut emissions by more than two-thirds by 2030 are met. “We urgently need a credible and lawful new action plan that puts our climate goals back on track and ensures we all benefit from a fair transition to a sustainable future. Meeting our domestic and international carbon reduction targets must be a top priority for whichever party wins the next general election.” Ed Miliband, the shadow energy secretary, said: “This is a new low even for this clown show of a government that has totally failed on energy and climate for 14 years. Their plan has now been found unlawful twice – once might have been dismissed as carelessness, twice shows they are incapable of delivering for this country. “The British people are paying the price for their failure in higher bills, exposed to the dictators like [Vladimir] Putin who control fossil fuel markets. Only Labour can tackle the climate crisis in a way that cuts bills for families, makes Britain energy independent, and tackles the climate crisis.” Caroline Lucas, the Green party MP, said: “Once again the government’s climate plan has been ruled unlawful. When dealing with the climate emergency, simply ‘hoping for the best’ and putting your faith in unproven technologies and vague policies is not good enough – we need concrete plans and investments and there is no time to lose. The government must now go back to the drawing board and urgently pull together a credible plan to put the UK back on track to delivering our climate commitments.” John Barrett, professor in energy and climate policy at the University of Leeds, said: “The UK government has failed to describe a credible pathway for the UK to achieve its legally binding climate commitments. This is despite overwhelming evidence from the Climate Change Committee and university researchers on the various options available to the government. Many of these options also deliver numerous co-benefits such as warmer homes, cheaper bills, more energy security, better air quality, more jobs and a healthier society. It is time for the UK government to take climate change seriously and tell us how they are going to achieve their own targets.” A DESNZ spokesperson said: “The UK can be hugely proud of its record on climate change. Not only are we the first major economy to reach halfway to net zero, we have also set out more detail than any other G20 country on how we will reach our ambitious carbon budgets. The claims in this case were largely about process and the judgment contains no criticism of the detailed plans we have in place. We do not believe a court case about process represents the best way of driving progress towards our shared goal of reaching net zero.”",,2024-05-03 10:14:44+00:00,Environment,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/may/03/britain-climate-action-plan-unlawful-high-court,The Guardian
66,,"Climate breakdown is likely to lead to the large-scale migration of venomous snake species into new regions and unprepared countries, according to a study. The researchers forecast that Nepal, Niger, Namibia, China, and Myanmar will gain the most venomous snake species from neighbouring countries under a heating climate. Low-income countries in south and south-east Asia, as well as parts of Africa, will be highly vulnerable to increased numbers of snake bites, according to the findings published in the journal Lancet Planetary Health. The study modelled the geographical distribution of 209 venomous snake species that are known to cause medical emergencies in humans to understand where different snake species might find favourable climatic conditions by 2070. While a majority of the venomous snake species will experience range contractions due to loss of tropical and subtropical ecosystems, habitats for some species such as the west African gaboon viper will increase by up to 250%, the study found. The ranges of the European asp and the horned viper were also forecast to more than double by 2070. However, some snakes, including the variable bush viper endemic to Africa and the hognosed pit viper of the Americas were projected to lose more than 70% of their range. “As more land is converted for agriculture and livestock rearing, it destroys and fragments the natural habitats that snakes rely on,” said study authors Pablo Ariel Martinez at the Federal University of Sergipe in Brazil and Talita F Amado at the German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research in Leipzig, Germany. “However, some generalist snake species, especially those of medical concern, can adapt to agricultural landscapes and even thrive in certain crop fields or livestock areas that provide food sources like rodents.” “Our research shows that when venomous snakes start showing up in new places, it’s a wake-up call for us to start thinking about how we can keep ourselves and our environment safe,” the study authors said. The World Health Organization estimates 1.8 to 2.7 million people are bitten by venomous snakes each year, causing up to 138,000 deaths and at least 400,000 amputations and permanent disabilities. The WHO categorised snakebite envenomation as a neglected tropical disease of the highest priority in 2017. “We are now finally getting a better handle on how snakes will change their distributions with climate change but there is also a major concern that they will bite more people if warm temperatures, severe wet weather events, and flooding that displaces snakes and people get more frequent,” said Anna Pintor, a research scientist with the WHO’s neglected tropical diseases group. “We urgently need to understand better how exactly this will affect where people get bitten, and how many people get bitten, so that we can prepare.” “Snakebite is in essence a human-animal-environment conflict. The modelling does not take into account how humans themselves will adapt/change to climate change. [But] the global study addresses a significant gap in knowledge,” said Soumyadeep Bhaumik, a medicine lecturer at the University of New South Wales in Sydney who was not involved in the study. “The need for countries with high [snakebite] burden to collaborate with neighbouring countries is something that the new study underlines.” “After all, international borders are not for snakes, they are for humans,” he added.",,2024-05-03 09:35:26+00:00,Environment,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/may/03/venomous-snakes-migrate-global-heating-study,The Guardian
67,,"One of Belgium’s mutual health insurers has been taking a closer look at the country’s three low emission zones. Dr Luk Bruyneel, a health and economics expert at Mutualités Libres, explained: “As a health insurance fund, we have to protect the health of our members. As air pollution is a major health risk, we want to contribute evidence to the debate. Health insurance data for our 2.3 million members allows us to produce high-quality studies on health risks from air pollution.” Antwerp was the first city to set up a zone in 2017. This was followed by Brussels, and then Ghent. Like London’s ultra-low emission zone (Ulez), and more than 320 schemes across Europe, the Belgian zones are designed to improve air pollution by deterring the most polluting vehicles from driving on city streets (generally the oldest diesels). As a key player in Belgium’s public health care, Mutualités Libres wanted to understand if the three zones had changed the air breathed by its members. It was not possible to make measurements at each person’s home, so the insurer used a computer model to calculate street-by street air pollution. Bruyneel and team looked at the air pollution outside the homes of 176,000 members who lived in Belgium’s 20 largest cities. Even without the low emission zones, air pollution would be expected to improve as older polluting vehicles were replaced with newer models. They therefore looked for any extra changes inside the zones compared with the 17 cities with no zone. Members inside the zones experienced faster improvement in air pollution compared with those in the other cities. This accelerated cleaning of the air was found for the main pollutants from traffic including nitrogen dioxide and particle pollution. They also looked at soot particles. These are a major air pollutant from the exhausts of older diesel vehicles. Antwerp and Brussels were the worst cities in Belgium before the zones started but this league table has now been turned upside down. The soot concentration around members’ homes in Brussels is lower than the average in cities across Belgium, and Antwerp has lower concentrations than the other cities in its region. After the zone, members in Antwerp also breathed less particle pollution than those in other cities in Flanders. In Brussels they found that the least well-off members experienced the worst air pollution, but for some pollutants the least well-off had the greatest gains. There is still a long way to go. Even in 2022 the least well-off were only enjoying the air quality that the richest had in 2017. Bruyneel added: “Air quality in Belgium is improving, but there is still a lot of work to be done to create healthy cities that people can enjoy more. Policymakers should support and embrace initiatives like LEZs to improve air quality in cities. This is not the time to press a ‘pause button’ or turn back the clock.” Next, the insurer will be looking for any changes in the medical bills for people inside the zones. Several studies on low emission zones around Europe and Japan have already found improvements in the numbers of heart attacks and strokes, and there is some evidence of improvement in lung illnesses too. Research by Mutualités Libres has already uncovered associations between air pollution and GP and emergency room visits in Belgium. They also found that short periods of high air pollution were linked to the onset of long periods of time off work for mental health problems. With Belgian elections due in June, 140 health and environment experts, including the health insurer, are calling on the county’s politicians to take more action on air pollution, by strengthening low emissions zones, creating green spaces and cycle paths, and building on the early success of low-traffic neighbourhoods. They illustrated their open letter with data on the 900 Brussels residents who die early each year due to poor air quality.",,2024-05-03 05:00:28+00:00,Environment,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/may/03/belgian-insurer-mutualites-libres-low-emission-zoneszones,The Guardian
68,,"Fossil fuel companies will be allowed to explore for oil and gas under offshore wind-power sites for the first time, the government will announce on Friday, in a move that campaigners said is further proof that ministers are abandoning the climate agenda. The North Sea Transition Authority (NSTA), which regulates North Sea oil and gas production, will confirm that it is granting licences to about 30 companies to look for hydrocarbons on sites earmarked for future offshore windfarms. The move has brought renewed criticism of Rishi Sunak from environmentalists, including from the prime minister’s own former net zero tsar, who worry that any future oil and gas production could hamper clean energy generation. But it will also give the embattled prime minister a welcome piece of news to sell to his restive backbenchers – many of whom are keen to see more oil and gas production in the North Sea – the day after what are set to be a bruising set of local election results. Chris Skidmore, the former Conservative MP who recently quit as Sunak’s net zero champion in protest at the government’s climate policies, said: “With a general election just months away, this is a deeply irresponsible and divisive move that goes against all advice from the International Energy Agency or the UN, and regrettably will further set back the UK’s climate reputation. “Instead of wind powering new oil, the investment should instead be in more wind and renewables. More fossil fuels will only create stranded assets and stranded jobs at a time when demand for oil and gas is falling.” He added: “This is a political and cynical stunt that will only backfire … We need to stop playing politics with climate and people’s future, and take a grownup position on seeking to find consensus for an end date to new oil and gas.”
A spokesperson for the NSTA said: “The NSTA have worked closely with other regulators to consider matters of co-location with offshore wind and other users.” Sources say that the oil exploration itself will not involve any drilling, with companies largely using data to decide whether sites have the potential to be profitable for extraction. Supporters of the scheme add that if any of the sites under windfarms prove suitable for production, oil and gas platforms will be able to use power from the wind turbines to lower their emissions. They will also have to strike an agreement with windfarm operators before they can begin drilling. Experts say, however, that the emissions from burning any oil and gas produced will far outweigh whatever is saved in the drilling and extraction processes. They add that Friday’s announcement is likely to undermine investor confidence in Britain’s green energy sector as a whole. The Guardian understands that investors in offshore wind have already expressed concern to the government about the decision, even threatening to pull out of the UK clean power sector altogether. Doug Parr, policy director at Greenpeace UK, said: “It’s hard to think of a worse use of clean electricity from windfarms than powering the dirty industry that’s driving the climate crisis. It’s like using a nicotine patch to roll a cigarette.” Sunak has made a series of announcements since becoming prime minister to roll back the government’s climate policies, including delaying the end of new sales of petrol and diesel cars and giving the green light for the huge new Rosebank oilfield off the coast of Shetland. The prime minister has said the policies are part of a push to bring energy costs down and improve energy security. But his critics believe Sunak is using them as a dividing issue between the Conservatives and Labour going into this year’s general election. Last month, Chris Stark, the outgoing head of the Climate Change Committee, accused the prime minister of abandoning Britain’s reputation as a world leader in the fight against the climate crisis. Sunak, however, is also under pressure from Tory rebels, with the party more than 20 points behind in the polls and heading for heavy losses after Thursday’s local elections. A group of unhappy backbenchers is planning a move to unseat him altogether if the Tories lose the mayoralties in both the Tees Valley and the West Midlands this weekend.
No 10 has been working for weeks on a fightback plan to ward off any potential coup, and sources have told the Guardian the prime minister is likely to put his energy policies at the heart of any offer he makes to get his own MPs back on side. Friday’s announcement marks the third phase in the 33rd round of North Sea oil and gas licensing. Earlier this year the government gave licences to 17 companies to look for hydrocarbons, including Shell, Equinor, BP, Total and Neo. This phase differs from previous ones, however, because officials are opening up parts of the sea which have been leased to offshore wind operators for the first time. The government issues about 100 licences a year, only 2% of which go on to receive consent for production. Dan McGrail, the chief executive of the trade body RenewableUK, said: “Prioritising offshore wind over oil and gas isn’t just the right choice for the planet, but given renewables are the lowest-cost means of generating power, we should be doing this for bill payers.” Parr said: “Most of the planet-heating emissions from oil and gas rigs come from burning the polluting fuels, not extracting them. “At best, this will make a small dent in the carbon footprint of a few oil companies’ operations. But more likely than not, it will end up greenwashing the fossil fuel industry’s image just as the government keeps trying to expand extraction against the advice of leading scientists and experts.” A spokesperson for the energy department said: “To strengthen our energy security and grow the economy, we want to maximise the huge energy potential of the North Sea. “We will continue to need oil and gas over the coming decades as we increase our share of renewables; that’s why we welcome the work by the NSTA and the Crown Estates to facilitate the co-location of wind and oil and gas projects as the offshore space gets busier.”",,2024-05-02 19:07:23+00:00,Environment,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/may/02/sunak-to-allow-oil-and-gas-exploration-at-sites-intended-for-offshore-wind,The Guardian
69, ,"On a warm morning in March, a group of researchers entered an unassuming chop suey parlor in the Sacramento suburbs for a rare field trip. The six history enthusiasts affiliated with the University of California, Davis, had gathered at the Chicago Cafe in Woodland, California, with one goal in mind: to determine the exact age of what may be the oldest Chinese restaurant in the country. From cabinets underneath the diner counter, they excavated box after box of ephemera that formed a time capsule of 20th-century Chinese immigrant experience. Among piles of letters, menus and tax receipts lay such relics as a vintage Chinese-English pocket dictionary, a 1976 Chinese edition California driver’s handbook, and black-and-white Polaroids of a newly crowned Miss Chinatown. To the experts’ trained eyes, seemingly any detail could reveal an artifact’s age, be it the digits of phone numbers, the typefaces on menus from decades past, or the clothing and makeup captured in photographs. Three generations of the Fong family, hailing from an impoverished region in southern China, built the Chicago Cafe into a linchpin of Woodland civic life. Current owners Paul and Nancy Fong, who began working at the restaurant a half-century ago, have been serving many of the same customers for decades. Some furnishings, like a pair of private booths and a wooden walk-in refrigerator, predate the couple’s employment, as do menu staples like the pork chow mein and chicken fried steak. “Clearly, there’s a respect for history,” Jack Chin, a professor at the UC Davis school of law who’s leading the research into the Chicago Cafe, told his team as they perused the documents.
The words “SINCE 1903” are inked on a white board behind the counter, a sight that stayed with Chin on his many visits to eat at the restaurant over the years. In a research paper published in January, he and his scholars from UC Davis verified that the diner had been in operation since at least 1910. After analyzing historical records in the Yolo county archives, including business directories, newspaper clippings and fire insurance maps, they concluded that the Chicago Cafe might have opened earlier than Pekin Noodle Parlors in Butte, Montana, which is widely recognized as the oldest existing Chinese eatery in the US. *** In the early 20th century, the restaurant industry provided a legal and financial lifeline to Chinese people. The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, which banned Chinese immigration to the US, later exempted merchants, a privileged class that included restaurant owners and managers. The so-called “chop suey” loophole allowed families like the Fongs to open up diners and bring over their kin. At the same time, restaurants remained a target of segregation. Chinese restaurateurs weren’t legally allowed to perform manual labor, including cooking and waiting tables. Later, as the popularity of chop suey parlors took off, officials across the country passed legislation banning white women from entering or working in them. Woodland’s Chinatown was not immune to the anti-Chinese fervor that swept across California, according to newspaper clips Chin’s team uncovered. A 1910 Woodland Daily Democrat editorial proclaimed that every Chinese or Japanese farmhand “drove a white man out of the orchard”. Businesses boasted of employing “white help only” in ads.
“Chinatown was thought to be blighted, slum,” Chin said. “There was clearly a sense of separation even as the restaurant provided a method of integration.” Yong Chen, author of Chop Suey, USA: The Story of Chinese Food in America, said Chinese restaurants like the Chicago Cafe endured not because Americans were enamored with Chinese food. Rather, they filled a void of “convenient and affordable” offerings missing from the gastronomical landscape, becoming a precursor of sorts to fast food chains. “The restaurant industry in the 20th century is not an industry people wanted to get into,” Chen said. “It’s so much hard work, the pay is so low and the hours are so long. But the Chinese had no choice and no jobs in other places.” Chen noted that the Chicago Cafe’s menus, which have changed little throughout its history, never served traditional Chinese dishes. Few restaurants in China serve Chicago Cafe staples like chop suey and egg foo young, let alone its broad selection of American classics like steak and eggs and hamburger with fries. The culinary choices cater to Americans’ perception and preference of Chinese food, Chen said, which isn’t atypical of popular 20th-century Chinese diners whose “main purpose is economic”.
“If they can make a living serving Chinese food, they’ll do it,” he said. “If they can make a living serving french fries, they’ll do it.” Hints of discrimination were evident in the records unearthed at the Chicago Cafe. Harley Spiller, a museum educator and collector from New York City who flew into Woodland the night before, noticed that some Chicago Cafe menus advertised “American food and chop suey” but omitted mentions of “Chinese food”. Other iterations divided American and Chinese dishes into separate columns, Spiller said, which some scholars have attributed to racism. “You wouldn’t mix and match,” he said.
Elizabeth Chin, an anthropologist and the sister of Jack Chin, said the typeface and phone numbers printed on said menus also offer valuable clues to the restaurant’s past. A three-digit number appeared on a few different Chicago Cafe menu sets, and a four-digit number appeared on a stack of order sheets. These types of phone numbers first appeared in the city directory at the turn of the 20th century. Chin, also an ethnographer, said that the art nouveau-style heading of these menu sets suggested a possible origin date in the 1910s, when the arched, calligraphic fonts became popularized. Ben Ruilin Fong, a comparative literature PhD candidate at UC Davis who is of no relation to the restaurant owners, said the Fongs seemed to be constantly negotiating with their identity as natives of Taishan, a city in China’s Guangdong province known as the “first home of overseas Chinese”. Like many others from the region, the Fongs fled to British-ruled Hong Kong, then the US, in search of new opportunities. “It’s interesting how they kept emphasizing they’re from Hong Kong rather than Guangzhou or Taishan,” Ben Ruilin Fong said, scanning a 1975 feature in a local paper. Taishanese immigrants, he said, often leverage their connection to Hong Kong, a city of higher status and class, to feel a sense of pride and heritage.
*** Paul and Nancy Fong have two adult children: Amy, who became a physical therapist, and Andy, a software engineer. Neither will be taking over the reins, but Paul Fong, 75, said he’s not concerned that the business his grandfather built more than 120 years ago might end with him. “I want to retire and spend more time with my grandchildren,” he said. Amy Fong described the recent media buzz, which drew hordes of new diners to the establishment, as a “blessing and a curse”. Lunch rush is busier than it’s been in decades, with retirees filling every booth and bar seat. The restaurant’s lone waitress, Dianna Olstad, rushed to deliver orders of chop suey, pork chow mein and ginger beef to the kitchen.
Like many Chinese restaurant workers, the Fongs worked punishing hours. Many decades ago, when Amy’s grandfather, John, was in charge, the Chicago Cafe operated from 5.30 am, to serve breakfast to farmers, until 3am, to serve patrons of nearby bars. For most of their adult lives, her parents never took a vacation, Amy said. As they age, she’s increasingly worried about their health – her grandmother died of a heart attack in the kitchen when she was 63. “They’re very stoic people,” Amy said. “They don’t talk much about their personal desires, hopes and dreams.” For some regulars who have been frequenting the Chicago Cafe for generations, the restaurant’s historic value is incalculable. Cindy Bueno, 74, started coming to the Chicago Cafe in the late 1950s, when her mother began working there as a waitress. For nearly the entirety of their adolescence, Bueno and her six sisters spent their afternoons at the restaurant, finishing homework or helping their mother wash dishes, chop onions and other simple chores. In 1968, Bueno held her wedding reception there, and everybody ate chicken fried steak. Years later, her children attended high school with Amy and Andy Fong. “Everyone who comes here has a history of the Chicago Cafe,” Bueno said. “This place is unforgettable.”
*** Despite his team’s laborious research efforts, Chin said, it may ultimately be impossible to definitively verify that the Chicago Cafe is the oldest Chinese restaurant in the nation. Official documentation simply doesn’t exist: Woodland city directories excluded Asian residents and businesses until 1939, which Chin said is likely an indication that officials didn’t consider Chinese people important enough to document. The strongest piece of evidence supporting a 1903 origin date, he said, is a 1940 report from the Woodland Daily Democrat: “For over 37 years, the Chicago Restaurant has served Woodland well with the finest of foods at extremely low prices.” (No living Fong knows the story behind the restaurant’s name, though Jack Chin said that “Chicago” was a common name for Chinese restaurants because the city had a reputation for serving superb Chinese cuisine.)
The date “1904” appeared twice in the trove of artifacts Chin’s team uncovered at the restaurant, on a business card and in a cryptic handwritten letter, but neither amounts to actual proof. But even without documentary evidence, Chin said he’s fairly certain that a 1903 origin date is accurate. Still, he isn’t giving up on his search. “We’re going to explore more long-shot research directions,” he said. Paul Fong, though, had surprisingly little to say about Chin’s quest to solidify his family’s legacy. His mind was more occupied by matters of culinary interest. As the lunch crowd thinned, he began clearing tables and chatting with regulars. When two women praised his chop suey, he gave them a brief overview of how the dish has evolved in the US. The traditional Cantonese version that his family has served for more than a century, he told them, incorporates bean sprouts. But most restaurants today, he said with a shake of the head, make the “New Hong Kong” variety that tastes like spaghetti. “Everyone from Sacramento, Dixon – they all come for our old Cantonese-style chop suey,” he said.",,2024-05-02 11:00:06+00:00,Environment,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/may/02/oldest-chinese-american-restaurant-chicago-cafe,The Guardian
70,,"People in Britain and Ireland are being asked to monitor their local rivers for pollution so a leading water charity can measure the scale of the sewage crisis. The Rivers Trust is this week launching the Big River Watch, asking people to record observations of their local rivers on a free app. The results will be made available through an interactive dashboard, and will help the organisation, as well as individuals and communities who can all access the data, to take action to improve rivers. Volunteers will be asked to identify sewage pollution, sewage fungus, minewater and silt, along with other indicators of river health, so pollution hotspots can be identified and tackled. The Rivers Trust is hoping for it to be the UK and Ireland’s biggest ever mass participation survey of river health. Tessa Wardley, director for communications and advocacy at the trust, said: “In September 2023, 60% of Big River Watch participants were new to citizen science, which shows just how important this tool is to help everyone get involved and showing they care about rivers. As well as learning where pollution and wildlife are spotted, we also want to know how spending time near rivers affects people’s wellbeing, so I’d encourage anyone and everyone to spend some time by their river and make their voice heard.” UK and Irish rivers have been choked by sewage pollution, as the sewer system allows untreated human waste to mix with rainwater and domestic wastewater, meaning that the pipes become overwhelmed. This toxic cocktail of sewage and chemicals is then drained into waterways to prevent it backing up into homes. Data first revealed by the Guardian found that 2023 was a record year for sewage spills. Raw sewage was discharged for more than 3.6m hours into rivers and seas in a 105% increase on the previous 12 months. Water industry figures have admitted that this is due to a lack of investment in pipes and sewers, and as climate breakdown brings heavier rains and the population rises, the system is failing. Emma Brisdion, marketing campaigns lead at the Rivers Trust, said: “Healthy rivers are essential for our wellbeing and for our wildlife. But rivers in the UK and Ireland have been allowed to get into a desperate state, and there are many people who care immensely about them and want to help. “The Big River Watch invites communities to get involved. The simple survey is all about using that connection to rivers to record the good, the bad, and the ugly so we can understand our blue spaces better and make informed decisions about how to revive them.”",,2024-05-02 10:55:22+00:00,Environment,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/may/02/big-river-watch-public-to-monitor-uk-and-irish-rivers-for-pollution,The Guardian
71, ,"There was something wrong with the chimpanzees. For weeks, a community of 205 animals in Uganda’s Kibale national park had been coughing, sneezing and looking generally miserable. But no one could say for sure what ailed them, even as the animals began to die. Necropsies can help to identify a cause of death, but normally, the bodies of chimps are found long after decomposition has set in, if at all. So when Tony Goldberg, a US wildlife epidemiologist visiting Kibale, got word that an adult female named Stella had been found freshly dead, he knew this was a rare opportunity to look for an answer. Goldberg and two Ugandan veterinary colleagues drove for two hours to a remote part of the park, then lugged their gear for another hour through the forested terrain to where Stella’s body lay. They lifted the 45kg animal on to a tarpaulin, and got to work. Crouching over the chimp – sweating beneath their full-body protective suits, their goggles fogging in the humid air – they meticulously worked through Stella’s organ systems, collecting samples. Not knowing what had killed her was “unnerving”, Goldberg recalls. “It could have been Ebola.”
As the necropsy progressed, however, Goldberg began to see telltale signs of a familiar disease: fluid buildup in Stella’s chest cavity and around her heart; lung tissue that was dark red, consolidated and marked with lesions. It looked like the chimp had died of severe pneumonia. Months later, molecular testing revealed the culprit: human metapneumovirus (HMPV), one of a collection of viruses that presents in people as a common cold but is “a well-known killer” in our closest primate relatives, says Goldberg, a researcher at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. More than 12% of the community that Stella belonged to died in the outbreak. Others were lost as a result of being orphaned. “Stella had a baby that was clinging to her body for a while after she died,” Goldberg says. “The baby subsequently died.” This phenomenon of animals catching diseases from humans, called reverse zoonoses, affects species around the world – from mussels contaminated with hepatitis A virus to tuberculosis transmitted to Asian elephants. But because of their evolutionary closeness to humans, great apes tend to be most vulnerable.
For some great ape populations that live in protected areas, reverse zoonoses are an even bigger threat than habitat loss or poaching. In a group at Kibale, for example, respiratory pathogens such as human rhinovirus C and HMPV have been the leading chimp killers for more than 35 years, accounting for almost 59% of deaths from a known cause.
For conservationists, the phenomenon presents a thorny problem. In many places in Africa, people live in close proximity to great apes. Great ape tourism has also become a central pillar of these endangered species’ conservation: ensuring habitats are preserved and local people are incentivised to support wildlife. But the same industry that funds protection of many apes could also be helping to drive them towards extinction, as close proximity to humans can expose the animals to deadly pathogens. Tourism is necessary for conservation, says Gladys Kalema-Zikusoka, a wildlife veterinarian and founder of Conservation Through Public Health, a nonprofit group in Entebbe, Uganda. “But it needs to be done carefully, otherwise we won’t have these animals around.” Some of the first records of reverse zoonoses in great apes were made by British primatologist Jane Goodall. In 1986, Goodall wrote that chimps “quite often” had colds and coughs, and “can contract the same contagious diseases as humans”. But conclusive evidence that chimps were being infected by people didn’t arrive until 2008, when Fabian Leendertz, the director of the Helmholtz Institute for One Health in Greifswald, Germany and his colleagues used molecular tools to show that human viruses were to blame for a decade’s worth of major respiratory disease outbreaks in chimps in Taï national park, Côte d’Ivoire. Since the paper came out, habitat destruction, human encroachment, the climate crisis and globalisation have only accelerated, and all of Africa’s great ape species are now decreasing. Eastern and western gorillas are both critically endangered, while chimpanzees and bonobos are endangered. The fact that human diseases can take out significant proportions of great ape communities makes the pathogens a dire threat to all four species. “Great ape populations can’t afford these sorts of losses,” Goldberg says. “Their populations are already so small, fragmented and declining that they just don’t have the ability to rebound or adapt.”
Many of the pathogens cause infections that, in a person, would result in an annoying but mild cold. In great apes, however, these diseases can be deadly, because the animals have no immunity or evolved genetic resistance. Once a chimpanzee or gorilla becomes unwell, there is usually little that can be done to help. There are also no vaccines for most common cold viruses. What could work, Goldberg realised, was a public-health approach: finding the source of pathogens and preventing them from getting into the populations in the first place. In 2015, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) released guidelines for great ape tourism, recommending that people stay at least 7 metres away from animals, tour groups limit their size, all visitors wear face masks and people who feel unwell be excluded. But there are obvious reasons why that doesn’t always happen. For one, it relies on honesty from international visitors. “Imagine you’re an American tourist, you’ve gone all the way to Africa, and this is your bucket-list trip,” Goldberg says. “Now you’ve got a stomach ache – and you’re not going to go see the gorillas? Of course you are.” Tourists often break rules while out in the field, either because of excitement in the moment or wilful disregard. “Some tourists just don’t listen,” says Kalema-Zikusoka. And local guides might or might not correct them. “They don’t want to be rude, and they find it hard to manage tourists.” Guides may also refrain from reproaching visitors for fear of losing a potential tip. Some guides “get tips that are twice the monthly salary of typical villagers in the area”, Goldberg says. “There are all these perverse incentives.” One 2020 study that analysed 282 YouTube videos of mountain gorilla tourism found that 40% depicted humans within arm’s reach of gorillas or engaging in physical contact with the animals. In another 2020 study, Darcey Glasser, then a graduate student at Hunter College of the City University of New York, joined 101 chimp treks at Kibale. Glasser observed tourists coughing during 88% of excursions; sneezing in 65%; and urinating in 37%. “Everyone’s touching everything,” she says.
Glasser presented her findings to wildlife officials in Uganda, who responded encouragingly, she says, adding hand-sanitising stations at the start of trails. In general, however, officials tend to avoid imposing strict rules that they think may impact visitors’ experiences. Great ape tourism is a key source of revenue for the 13 African countries where it occurs, Leendertz says, so reverse zoonosis is “not always an easy topic”. Officials at the Uganda Wildlife Authority, which oversees the country’s national parks and all tourism activity in them, did not respond to multiple interview requests. Ecotourism represents one serious disease risk for great apes, but it cannot account for all cases of reverse zoonoses. Some great ape populations never see a tour group – Stella’s community among them – yet still experience deadly outbreaks of human pathogens. As Goldberg thought about how to tackle this problem, he noticed a perplexing pattern in the list of human pathogens that typically afflict great apes: they’re the infections that, like clockwork, young children catch when they go back to school, and then bring home.
Great apes, it occurred to him, could be catching diseases from adults who go into the forest after catching pathogens from their children. The idea seemed even more plausible when Goldberg realised that adults infected with these “sniffle germs” often show no symptoms, even as they shed copious viral particles. Goldberg secured a grant for new research, led by Taylor Weary, an epidemiologist who recently graduated from Goldberg’s lab, alongside Patrick Tusiime, health coordinator for the Kasiisi Project, a nonprofit group that supports primary schools around Kibale. They compared monthly nasal swabs from local schoolchildren, parents who worked in the forest, and faecal samples from the chimps.
The findings, which are now in review for publication, confirmed Goldberg’s original hypothesis. Every respiratory pathogen that has caused a chimp outbreak in Kibale was present in children living nearby. Then, during Uganda’s most stringent Covid-19 lockdown between March and September 2020, the researchers observed an “extraordinarily clear” drop in infections across the board, Goldberg says, suggesting that schools are indeed a major source of transmission. The message, Goldberg says, was clear: “To save the chimps, we have to make kids healthier.” One big takeaway from the findings was that the current model is inadequate to reduce the risk of reverse zoonoses in Kibale’s chimpanzees, and probably in great apes in Africa as a whole. It hinges on stopping symptomatic people from going into the forest, but infected adults are usually asymptomatic. Forbidding guides and trackers from working whenever their children are ill isn’t a solution, Goldberg says: kids “are sick all the time”. Banning tourism also wouldn’t work. Parks depend on visitor fees to pay salaries, maintain local support for conservation and justify the cost of setting land aside for wildlife. “When I was growing up, the perception was that chimps are bad,” says Tusiime, who was born in a rural village near Kibale. “Now there’s a shift to a positive attitude towards chimpanzees because they bring in tourists, they bring in revenue.” Focusing on making children living near great apes healthier, then, could be the best bet for keeping human diseases out of great ape populations. Programmes have already been launched to reduce transmission among local children, teaching handwashing and other hygiene measures.
Scientists also believe that enforcement of existing biosecurity rules could go a long way toward reducing transmission – but that will require focused commitment from African governments and tourism providers, says Cristina Gomes, a wildlife conservationist at Florida International University in Miami who helped launch a working group to identify new strategies. One idea is to entitle guides working with chimps to paid sick days – a luxury most do not have. Another suggestion is to certify companies that follow best practices, justifying a slightly higher fee for their services. Common cold viruses cannot be eradicated, and people and great apes won’t be staying apart anytime soon. Goldberg says outbreaks of respiratory disease were documented in chimps in at least five locations throughout sub-Saharan Africa in 2023 alone. The hope, however, is that these will become rarer as scientists, officials, rural residents and tourists gain a deeper understanding of the problem. “Behavioural change takes time, but if you’re committed, it eventually happens,” Tusiime says. “So we need to start now.” • A version of this report was previously published in Nature • Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on X for all the latest news and features",,2024-05-02 05:00:50+00:00,Environment,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/may/02/great-ape-tourism-chimpanzee-common-cold-reverse-zoonoses-uganda-aoe,The Guardian
72,,"You might visit Amsterdam for its canals, and who could blame you, really. But the truly interesting waterways aren’t under your feet – they’re above your head. Beautiful green roofs have popped up all over the world: specially selected plants growing on structures designed to manage the extra weight of biomass. Amsterdam has taken that one step further with blue-green roofs, specially designed to capture rainwater. One project, the resilience network of smart, innovative, climate-adaptive rooftops (Resilio), has covered more than 9,000 sq metres (100,000 sq ft) of Amsterdam’s roofs, including 8,000 sq metres on social housing complexes. Citywide, the blue-green roof coverage is even bigger, estimated at more than 45,000 sq metres. The “sponge city” concept is becoming increasingly popular. Planners deploy more green spaces that soak up downpours that are getting heavier as the world warms. That simultaneously reduces flooding and recharges the underlying layer of absorbent rock, which can then be tapped into in times of need. Whereas cities used to be designed to divert rainwater away as quickly as possible, increasingly, they are exploiting that resource.
A big challenge with sponge cities is that so much of an urban area is rooftops. Green roofs will soak up some rainwater to hydrate the plants there, but blue-green roofs go a step further, with infrastructure that gathers the liquid, stores it and dispenses it to the building’s residents for watering plants and flushing toilets. The system works in layers. At the surface, you have plants: some combination of mosses, shrubs, grasses, ferns, herbs and sedum, a hardy genus that’s a staple of green roofs. (While plants need sunlight to survive, on a roof, they can be bombarded with too much light. It can also get hot and windy up there.) The plants are rooted in soil, providing nutrients and support. Below that is a filter layer, which keeps the soil from getting into the next layer: a lightweight crate system that stores the water. Finally, below that are additional layers to keep water and plant roots from infiltrating the actual roof. “You have, in fact, a flat rain barrel on top of your roof,” says Kasper Spaan, policy developer for climate adaptation at Waternet, Amsterdam’s public water management organisation, which is participating in Resilio. The water levels in the blue-green roof are managed by a smart valve. If the forecast says a storm is coming, the system will release stored water from the roof ahead of time. That way, when a downpour comes, the roof refills, meaning less rainwater enters the gutters and sewers in the surrounding area. In other words, the roof becomes a sponge that can be wrung out as needed. “In the ‘squeezable’ sponge city, you make the whole city malleable,” says Spaan.
This makes the traditional system of stormwater management more flexible, but also more complicated. So the Resilio project used software from Autodesk to model the impact of blue-green roofs and the risk of flooding in Amsterdam, also adjusting for climate breakdown. “You can take a look at historical flood patterns and then you can do simulations that will help you understand. If I could take this much capacity out of the drainage network, when the storm comes, I’m going reduce flooding by 10, 15, 20%,” says Amy Bunszel, Autodesk’s executive vice-president of architecture, engineering and construction design solutions. “So our software allows them to do simulations and play with different trade-offs.” Beyond the sponge-city benefits, blue-green roofs can cool the top floor of a building, essentially “sweating” off the stored water. With the right kinds of indigenous plant, they can help wildlife by catering to native pollinating insects. Going a step further, scientists are experimenting with growing crops on rooftops under solar panels, known as rooftop agrivoltaics. Theoretically, pairing that with blue-green systems could improve the efficiency of the solar panels by cooling them with the evaporating water.
Not every building can go blue-green. The additional infrastructure is not very heavy, but the water it holds is. So while it is relatively cheap and easy to build the system into new construction, accounting for the extra weight, older buildings may need retrofits to accommodate it. In the long term, it can save a building money by reducing the volume of water bought from a municipal system. Like any technology, its cost will fall as it is more widely deployed. The idea is for places experiencing worsening droughts and flooding to deploy not only sponge city concepts on the ground – like patches of dirt with drought-tolerant plants to absorb stormwater into aquifers – but on top of their buildings as well. “We think the concept is applicable to many urban areas around the world,” says Spaan. “In the south of Europe – Italy and Spain – where there are really drought-stressed areas, there’s new attention for rainwater catchment.” Cities could even incentivise blue-green roofs by providing tax breaks, rewarding building owners for reducing their contribution of stormwater to overburdened sewer and water systems. US cities such as Los Angeles and Pittsburgh have been rolling out something similar: taxes on the amount of impermeable area on a property, encouraging landowners to develop gardens and other green spaces. The city of tomorrow, then, isn’t the concrete-smothered metropolis of science fiction, but an increasingly green and spongey landscape that can be squeezed in times of need. “Our philosophy in the end is not that on every roof, everything is possible,” says Spaan, “but that on every roof, something is possible.” This article was previously published by Wired and was shared with the Guardian as part of the Climate Desk collaboration",,2024-05-02 05:00:50+00:00,Environment,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/may/02/on-every-roof-something-is-possible-how-sponge-cities-could-change-the-way-we-handle-rain,The Guardian
73,,"Oil and gas equipment intended to cut methane emissions is preventing scientists from accurately detecting greenhouse gases and pollutants, a satellite image investigation has revealed. Energy companies operating in countries such as the US, UK, Germany and Norway appear to have installed technology that could stop researchers from identifying methane, carbon dioxide emissions and pollutants at industrial facilities involved in the disposal of unprofitable natural gas, known in the industry as flaring. Flares are used by fossil fuel companies when capturing the natural gas would cost more than they can make by selling it. They release carbon dioxide and toxic pollutants when they burn as well as cancer-causing chemicals. Despite the health risks, regulators sometimes prefer flaring to releasing natural gas – which is 90% methane – directly into the atmosphere, known as “venting”. The World Bank, alongside the EU and other regulators, have been using satellites for years to find and document gas flares, asking energy companies to find ways of capturing the gas instead of burning or venting it. The bank set up the Zero Routine Flaring 2030 initiative at the Paris climate conference to eradicate unnecessary flaring, and its latest report stated that flaring decreased by 3% globally from 2021 to 2022. But since the initiative, “enclosed combustors” have begun appearing in the same countries that promised to end flaring. Experts say enclosed combustors are functionally the same as flares, except the flame is hidden. Tim Doty, a former regulator at the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, said: “Enclosed combustors are basically a flare with an internal flare tip that you don’t see. Enclosed flaring is still flaring. It’s just different infrastructure that they’re allowing. “Enclosed flaring is, in truth, probably less efficient than a typical flare. It’s better than venting, but going from a flare to an enclosed flare or a vapour combustor is not an improvement in reducing emissions.” The only method of detecting flaring globally is by using satellite-mounted tools called Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite of detectors (VIIRS), which find flares by comparing heat signatures with bright spots of light visible from space. But when researchers tried to replicate the database, they saw that the satellites were not picking up the enclosed flares. Eric Kort, an associate professor at the University of Michigan, said: “The VIIRS satellite database is still the standard product that scientists use globally. It’s the best, most consistent product we currently have. “If you enclose the flare, people don’t see it, so they don’t complain about it. But it also means it’s not visible from space by most of the methods used to track flare volumes.” Without the satellite data, countries were forced to rely mostly on self-disclosed reporting from oil and gas companies, researchers said. Environmentalists fear the research community’s ability to understand pollution and greenhouse gas emissions from the energy sector could be jeopardised. Colorado became the first and only US state to ban routine flaring in 2021. But Maxar satellite imagery shows enclosed flares replacing open-lit flares in the run-up to the Colorado ban on flaring, which provided a carve-out clause for enclosed flaring devices.
Google Earth historical images of one site in Jackson County, Colorado, show a lit flame disappearing and being replaced with an enclosed flaring device. Because the flaring within the site is not detectable, it is difficult for researchers to determine when it is burning and for what purpose.
The NGO Earthworks, with an optical gas-imaging camera usually used by industry specialists looking for emissions leaks, recorded footage showing invisible pollutants coming from the device. However, the site’s owner, Fulcrum Energy Capital Funds, told the Guardian it had eliminated flaring from its facilities.
Methane and carbon dioxide plumes were seen coming from enclosed flaring devices in the Four Corners region of New Mexico, according to satellite data from CarbonMapper, which provides publicly accessible data on greenhouse gases.
In November 2023, the EU announced a plan to phase out routine flaring as part of legislation designed to tackle methane emissions. But enclosed flares have started to appear in the EU, with information from oil and gas equipment supplier websites suggesting the devices are being sold in multiple member states. Satellite images show enclosed flares at Ineos facilities in Grangemouth, Scotland, and the Ineos Rafnes refinery in Norway. In Germany, enclosed flares can be seen at facilities owned by the steel manufacturer ArcelorMittal.
An Ineos spokesperson said the enclosed flare “leads to significantly less noise being emitted and much lower luminosity”, adding that these things were important for communities living and working close to its sites.
An ArcelorMittal spokesperson said: “We installed an enclosed flaring device as a precautionary measure, so that the flare is not visible from a distance if gas had to be flared at night.” The device had a 100% combustion rate andno measurable emissions, the company added. Zubin Bamji, the programme manager of the World Bank’s Global Flaring and Methane Reduction Partnership, said volumes from enclosed flares were “very small and are unlikely to have a significant impact on flare volume estimates at a regional, country or global level”, but confirmed that VIIRS did not classify enclosed flaring devices as flares. A source with knowledge of upcoming EU methane legislation said it “covers all flares, not just those detectable by satellite”, and added that flaring in emergency situations would still be allowed. It was not immediately clear how the EU would determine whether flaring inside enclosed flares was routine or for emergency situations.

74,,"Blue-green algae, or cyanobacteria, come in many forms and have generally got a bad press, mainly because five of the 2,000 identified species can produce some of the deadliest toxins known to science. At the same time, they are among the oldest organisms in the world, dating back 2.1bn years, and we owe them a debt of gratitude. Cyanobacteria were the first organisms to use photosynthesis, turning carbon dioxide into oxygen. They are responsible for creating the oxygen-rich atmosphere that enabled life on Earth to flourish and humans to evolve. In their untold trillions, in almost every environment where there is water, even on damp rocks in deserts, they continue this valuable service, keeping the atmosphere safe for mammals to breathe. But in nutrient-rich water, created by farm waste or sewage released into rivers and lakes, blue-green algae multiply fast, especially in warm sunshine. This is dangerous in still waters where they form dense rafts of scum that deprive the waters below of oxygen, killing fish. In some circumstances they also create toxins that can poison animals and humans that drink it.

The Israeli military said it was conducting “counterterrorism activities in the area”. The raid was the latest in a series of clashes between Israeli forces and Palestinians in the occupied West Bank that have been ongoing for years but have stepped since the war began. At least 460 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces or Jewish settlers in the West Bank or East Jerusalem since 7 October, according to the Palestinian health ministry.",,2024-05-04 14:22:41+00:00,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/may/04/middle-east-crisis-israel-gaza-hamas-war-ceasefire-talks,The Guardian
77,"US secretary of state Antony Blinken has said that Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s handling of the Israel-Hamas war reflects the position of “a large majority of Israelis”, the Times of Israel reports.","US secretary of state Antony Blinken has said that Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s handling of the Israel-Hamas war reflects the position of “a large majority of Israelis”, the Times of Israel reports. The Times of Israel quotes Blinken as saying at an event in Arizona: “This is a complicated government. It’s a balancing act when you have a coalition. And if you’re just looking at the politics of it, that’s something that he has to factor in.” The outlet reported that Blinken said that regardless of views on Netanyahu and his government, “what’s important to understand is that much of what he’s doing is not simply a reflection of his politics or his policies; it’s actually a reflection of where a large majority of Israelis are in this moment”. Polls last month show nearly three-quarters of the Israeli public want Netanyahu to resign. 68% said Netanyahu is not doing well in his handling of the war, compared with 29% who said he is, the poll by Kan found, according to the Times of Israel. Respondents were also asked whether the government is “doing enough to bring back the hostages,” to which 56% responded that it was not and 39% said it was. A bit of further context: the surveys come after a poll in January showed the majority of Israelis (81.5%) believed the best way to secure the release of hostages was by exerting military pressure on Hamas until it agreed to terms acceptable to Israel for their release. In the same January poll, the public was asked whether the release of hostages or victory against Hamas was more important, with a slight majority of 46.6% responding that it was more important that the hostages be released, and 44.8% choosing the war’s outcome.",,2024-05-04 13:47:46+00:00,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/may/04/middle-east-crisis-israel-gaza-hamas-war-ceasefire-talks,The Guardian
78,,"At the Jerusalem theatre this week, concertgoers and staff expressed a mixture of anger, sadness and defiance as weeks of pro-Palestinian protests across dozens of US college campuses reached a tumultuous climax 6,000 miles away. The noisy demonstrations have been closely followed in Israel, reported by major media and discussed by prominent public figures. Idan Degani, a security guard at the theatre, said many in Israel viewed the protests with confusion and anxiety, seeing them as an attack on the country and not just its government. “We didn’t know so many people hated Israel. I don’t think these young people know a lot about Israel or about the conflict. I think the older people do, but not this younger generation,” the 28-year-old said, as he watched late arrivals hurry for a programme of Haydn and Schubert. “I certainly don’t think it will change how anyone here sees the war.” Such feelings appear widespread among the Jewish majority in Israel, seven months after war was triggered by surprise attacks launched by Hamas into the south of the country in which about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, were killed and 250 taken hostage. “We thought we understood how much hate there was out there. I mean, I’m a child of Holocaust survivors, but it’s still such a shock. It makes it unbelievably real,” said Danae Marx, a public relations specialist at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem.

79,,"In Bethlehem, food stalls are sparse as farmlands are under attack. The Guardian spoke to a Palestinian restauranteur about the fight to keep his people’s heritage alive through food. Fadi Kattan looked forlornly at the stalls inside the Bethlehem vegetable market bearing small quantities of oranges, watermelons and cauliflowers. “This stall should be heaped with products, he said. “And over there should be piles of aubergines and courgettes.” The watermelons from Jenin looked too small for the season, while he wasn’t sure where the boxes of oranges were from. They would normally be from Gaza. At Um Nabil’s stall in the West Bank market where Kattan is a regular customer, she told him she could no longer afford to bring in the best small local cucumbers or piles of green cherries from her village of Artas.
Kattan, a chef with restaurants in Bethlehem and in London, opens his forthcoming book, named after the city where he grew up, by saying cooking is “how I tell Bethlehem’s story”. It was after the book had gone to print, when on 7 October Hamas attacked towns and kibbutzim in southern Israel, followed by an intense Israeli bombardment of Gaza, that daily life changed dramatically. The destruction of Gaza’s agricultural land has meant no citrus, strawberries or vegetables, which would normally be sold in the West Bank at this time of year. A wave of attacks from Israeli settlers in the West Bank, combined with road closures and raids by Israeli forces, has also left farmers in the towns around Bethlehem struggling to farm or bring their products to market.

80,Summary,"Here is a quick roundup of where we are today: Hamas negotiators have arrived in Cairo for further talks on a possible Gaza truce. The delegation’s arrival comes after a senior Hamas spokesperson reportedly said that ceasefire talks remain ongoing, with Israel’s planned Rafah assault a “key” issue. A stumbling block in the talks has been a longterm ceasefire: Hamas has long called for Israel to commit to ending its offensive; while Israel insists that a truce will be followed by it resuming fighting in order to root out Hamas. The Hamas-run Gaza health ministry has published the latest casualty figures: at least 34,654 Palestinians have been killed, and 77,908 injured. It said 32 people were killed and 41 injured in the latest 24-hour reporting period. Israel has briefed the US on its plan to evacuate Palestinian civilians during a planned offensive on the southern city of Rafah, US officials familiar with the matter have told AP – but the US administration reportedly remains unchanged in its view that the assault would risk too many civilian lives.

An unnamed Palestinian official familiar with the mediation efforts also expressed cautious optimism, telling Reuters: “Things look better this time but whether an agreement is on hand would depend on whether Israel has offered what it takes for that to happen.” Negotiations have been impeded by Hamas’ long-standing demand for Israel to commit to ending its offensive clashing with Israel’s insistence on resuming its operations to dismantle Hamas following any truce.

82,Students involved in a pro-Palestinian encampment protest on the grounds of Trinity College in Dublin have vowed to maintain their action “indefinitely”.,"Students involved in a pro-Palestinian encampment protest on the grounds of Trinity College in Dublin have vowed to maintain their action “indefinitely”. Visitors were unable to access the historic Book of Kells on Saturday due to the action that began on Friday evening when student activists set up tents on the university campus, the PA news agency reports. Photos on social media showed benches stacked up blocking the entrance to the manuscript and tourist attraction. Protesters have vowed to keep up a “blockade” of the Book of Kells until the university cuts its ties to Israel.
Trinity College said the encampment was “unauthorised”, and while it supported the right of students to protest, such action must be taken within the rules of the university. Organisers said 70 students in 43 tents took part. Outgoing students’ union president Laszlo Molnarfi said he and fellow protesters would remain indefinitely. “We plan on staying here indefinitely, our message is there is no business as usual during a genocide,” he told the PA news agency.
“And when our academic institution, Trinity College Dublin, has ties to Israeli companies, entities and universities that are complicit in the war industry, we must speak up. “And that is why we are doing this. And we must speak up in this disruptive, powerful way.

The International Centre of Justice for Palestinians (ICJP) called his detention an “unacceptable harassment of a globally respected medical professional”. “By design, the Germans are silencing a key witness to Israel’s war crimes.

89,A small number of US universities have reached deals with pro-Palestinian student protesters following weeks of demonstrations.,"A small number of US universities have reached deals with pro-Palestinian student protesters following weeks of demonstrations. With more than 2,400 people on 46 campuses nationwide since mid-April, AP reports that schools including Brown, Northwestern and Rutgers stand out for taking a different approach. Agreements from such schools included commitments to review their investments in Israel or hear calls to stop doing business with the country. Many protester demands have focussed on links to the Israeli military. But while universities have made concessions around amnesty for protesters and funding for Middle Eastern studies, they have not promised to change their investments. Ralph Young, a history professor who studies American dissent at Temple University in Philadelphia, said concessions and negotiations may be being used tactically. “I think for some universities, it might be just a delaying tactic to diffuse the protests,” said Young. “The end of the semester is happening now. And maybe by the time the next semester begins, there is a ceasefire in Gaza.” Some university boards may never even vote on divesting from Israel, which can be a complicated process, Young said. And some state universities have said they don’t have the authority to do so. But Young said holding talks with protesters is a better tactic than arrests, which can stir up further protests. Talking “at least gives the protesters the feeling that they’re getting somewhere,” he said. “Whether they are getting somewhere or not is another question.”",,2024-05-04 08:24:48+00:00,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/may/04/middle-east-crisis-israel-gaza-hamas-war-ceasefire-talks,The Guardian

Badran charged that Netanyahu’s insistence on attacking Rafah was calculated to “thwart any possibility of concluding an agreement” in the negotiations brokered by Egyptian, Qatari and US mediators. Foreign mediators have waited for a Hamas response to a proposal to halt the fighting for 40 days and exchange hostages for Palestinian prisoners, which its chief Ismail Haniyeh has said the group was considering in a “positive spirit”. A major stumbling block has been that, while Hamas has demanded a lasting ceasefire, Netanyahu has vowed to crush its remaining fighters in the far-southern city of Rafah, which is packed with displaced civilians. Netanyahu has insisted he will send ground troops into Rafah, despite strong concerns voiced by UN agencies and ally Washington for the safety of the 1.2 million civilians inside the city.

95,,"A London surgeon who has provided testimony over the ongoing war in Gaza after operating during the conflict has been denied entry to France, where he was due to speak in the French senate later on Saturday. After arriving at Charles De Gaulle airport north of Paris on Saturday morning on a flight from London, Prof Ghassan Abu-Sitta, a plastic and reconstructive surgeon, was informed by French authorities that Germany had enforced a Schengen-wide ban on his entry to Europe. French police said the German authorities, who had previously refused Abu-Sitta entry to Germany in April, had put a visa ban on him for a year, meaning he was banned from entering any Schengen country. It is not clear whether Abu-Sitta was aware of this before flying to Paris. “They are preventing me from entering France. I am supposed to speak at the French senate today,” said Abu-Sitta, who had been invited by Green party parliamentarians to take part in a conference at the Sénat, the upper house, to speak about Gaza. The theme of the conference was: France and its responsibility in the application of international law in Gaza. “In an act of utter vindictiveness the French authorities are denying me access to an earlier flight and insisting on sending me on the last flight back late night to London,” Abu-Sitta wrote on X. The Elysée said it was not aware of Abu-Sitta’s being refused entry to France but a spokesperson told Le Monde: “When it’s a question of a Schengen refuse, the border police can’t do much about it.” During the months of October and November 2023 at the beginning of Israel’s war on Gaza that has since killed more than 34,000 Palestinians, Abu-Sitta operated from Gaza’s al-Shifa and al-Ahli Baptist hospitals. During his 43 days, he described witnessing a “massacre unfold” in Gaza and the use of white phosphorus munitions, which Israel has denied. He has also provided evidence to Scotland Yard. Raymonde Poncet Monge, the Europe Écologie-Les Verts senator who organised the conference, said she condemned the police action and said they had contacted the office of the interior minister, Gérald Darmanin in an attempt to allow Abu-Sitta entry without success. “How can Germany issue territorial bans throughout the Schengen area? It’s mind-boggling! This is a new step in the repression of everything to do with Palestine,” said Poncet Monge, who later posted a photograph of Abu-Sitta attending the conference via video. “We are outraged that he cannot be present among us,” she said. The International Centre of Justice for Palestinians (ICJP), an independent organisation of lawyers, politicians and academics who support the rights of Palestinians, called his detention an “unacceptable harassment of a globally respected medical professional”. In January, the ICJP handed evidence to Scotland Yard in relation to alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in Gaza under applicable UK legislation, including evidence from Abu-Sitta. A statement by the organisation said: “By design, the Germans are silencing a key witness to Israel’s war crimes. This follows their action taken on 12 April to bar Dr Abu-Sitta’s entry to Berlin to participate in the Palestine Congress – an event which German police later disbanded.” Israel denies it has committed war crimes in Gaza and says it is acting in self-defence after Hamas’s 7 October attack. The ICJP director, Tayab Ali, called the incident “outrageous” and “unacceptable” as Abu-Sitta had his phone taken from him by airport authorities while they were on the phone. “We have instructed lawyers in Germany to bring this to the attention of the German courts,” he said.

96,,"Hopes of a ceasefire in Gaza rose on Saturday as a Hamas delegation arrived in Cairo to continue indirect talks, with what is believed to be a response to a new proposal, reportedly agreed by Israel, to halt fighting for an initial 40 days and exchange hostages for Palestinian prisoners. Egyptian and US mediators have reported signs of compromise in recent days and Egyptian state news channel Al-Qahera said on Saturday that a consensus had been reached in the indirect talks over many of the disputed points but gave no further details. However, many analysts remain pessimistic after five months of stop-start talks that have frequently broken down. Negotiators have consistently struggled to reconcile Hamas’s demand for a lasting ceasefire which would allow the organisation to claim a victory with the apparent determination of Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, to force Hamas from power, kill or capture its leadership and destroy all its military capabilities.
A senior Israeli official, speaking on Saturday on condition of anonymity to discuss ongoing negotiations, played down the prospects for a full end to the war. The official said Israel was committed to an offensive on Rafah, Gaza’s southernmost city, and that it would not agree in any circumstance to end the war as part of a hostage-release deal. Egyptian sources told the Wall Street Journal that Israel would give the truce talks another week, after which it would launch its long-threatened offensive. The US has sought to pressure Hamas to accept the latest proposals, which are widely seen as a last chance to avert intense new fighting. Any Israeli offensive in Rafah is likely to bring many new civilian casualties and exacerbate the acute humanitarian crisis in Gaza.
“The only thing standing between the people of Gaza and a ceasefire is Hamas,” the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said on Friday. Blinken also reiterated Washington’s objections to a Rafah offensive, saying Israel had not presented a credible plan to protect the 1.2 million or more civilians displaced from elsewhere in Gaza who have sought refuge in sprawling, tented refugee camps and UN shelters there. “Absent such a plan, we can’t support a major military operation going into Rafah because the damage it would do is beyond what’s acceptable,” he said. Humanitarian groups and the United Nations have also repeatedly called on Israel to call off a Rafah attack. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO director general, warned on Friday that a full-scale military operation in Rafah “could lead to a bloodbath, and further weaken an already broken health system”. Israeli officials say a Rafah ground offensive is essential to achieve Israel’s stated war aims because thousands of Hamas fighters and the militant Islamist organisation’s leaders are based there. Hamas seized about 250 hostages during the surprise attack into southern Israel in October last year that triggered the war. About half are still held in Gaza, with many thought to be in or under Rafah. About 1,200 died in the October Hamas attack, mostly civilians. More than 34,600 have died in Gaza, mostly women and children, in the ensuing Israeli military offensive. Israel says Hamas is using civilians as human shields, a charge the organisation denies. Israeli strikes early on Saturday on Gaza killed at least six people. Three bodies were recovered from the rubble of a building in Rafah and taken to Yousef al-Najjar hospital. A strike in the Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza also killed three people, according to hospital officials. In the last 24 hours, the bodies of 32 people killed by Israeli strikes have been brought to local hospitals, Gaza’s health ministry said on Saturday. The ministry does not distinguish between fighters and civilians in its tallies. Hamas, which has been in power in the Gaza Strip since 2007, says it is considering the latest truce proposal with a “positive spirit”. But the group is deeply divided, and statements made by its political wing, now mainly based in Istanbul, often do not reflect the views of Yahya Sinwar, the organiser of the October attacks and most senior Hamas leader in Gaza. Observers say that it is significant that the Hamas delegation now in Cairo is led by Khalil al-Hayya, deputy head of the group’s political arm in Gaza, rather than a more senior figure who might lack credibility with Sinwar, who has ultimate authority over any deal. The Israeli government is also deeply divided. Senior members of its war cabinet are keen to secure a ceasefire and free surviving prisoners but far-right ministers have threatened to bring down Netanyahu’s ruling coalition if the war is not continued with greater force. The United States, along with Egypt and Qatar, has been trying to seal a ceasefire deal in the nearly seven-month-old war. During the last truce, over one week in November, 80 Israeli hostages were exchanged for 240 Palestinian prisoners. Up to a third of those remaining in Hamas captivity are now thought to be dead. Israel’s siege has pushed many of Gaza’s 2.4 million people to the brink of famine. US pressure has prompted Israel to facilitate more aid deliveries to Gaza, including through the reopened Erez crossing that leads directly into the hardest-hit north. Last week, Israeli settlers blocked a convoy using a new route from Jordan before it crossed into Gaza. Once inside the territory, the convoy was commandeered by Hamas militants, before UN officials reclaimed it. Food availability has improved “a little bit”, according to the UN and residents in Rafah interviewed by the Guardian, with prices for some basics dropping to near prewar levels in southern areas where there is most aid. The US-based charity World Central Kitchen resumed operations this week, after suspending them in the aftermath of Israeli drone strikes that killed seven of its staff as they unloaded aid in Gaza on 1 April. World Central Kitchen was involved in an effort earlier this year to establish a new maritime aid corridor to Gaza from Cyprus to help compensate for dwindling deliveries by land from Israel. The project suffered a further setback on Friday when the US military announced high winds had forced troops working to assemble a temporary aid pier off the Gaza coast to relocate to the Israeli port of Ashdod.",,2024-05-04 13:27:37+00:00,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/may/04/hopes-of-gaza-ceasefire-rise-as-hamas-delegation-arrives-in-cairo,The Guardian
97,,"Fadi Kattan looked forlornly at the stalls inside the Bethlehem vegetable market bearing small quantities of oranges, watermelons and cauliflowers. “This stall should be heaped with products, he said. “And over there should be piles of aubergines and courgettes.” The watermelons from Jenin looked too small for the season, while he wasn’t sure where the boxes of oranges were from. They would normally be from Gaza. At Um Nabil’s stall in the West Bank market where Kattan is a regular customer, she told him she could no longer afford to bring in the best small local cucumbers or piles of green cherries from her village of Artas.
Kattan, a chef with restaurants in Bethlehem and in London, opens his forthcoming book, named after the city where he grew up, by saying cooking is “how I tell Bethlehem’s story”. It was after the book had gone to print, when on 7 October Hamas attacked towns and kibbutzim in southern Israel, followed by an intense Israeli bombardment of Gaza, that daily life changed dramatically. The destruction of Gaza’s agricultural land has meant no citrus, strawberries or vegetables, which would normally be sold in the West Bank at this time of year. A wave of attacks from Israeli settlers in the West Bank, combined with road closures and raids by Israeli forces, has also left farmers in the towns around Bethlehem struggling to farm or bring their products to market. “The long-term impact will take years to recover from, but the impact on human beings will be even longer,” said Kattan. “People think the Palestinians have the tools to deal with this, but they shouldn’t be required to.”
Israeli checkpoints and an Israeli-built wall cut into Bethlehem, while dozens of Israeli settlements surround it in three directions. “These are expanding every day,” Kattan said. “The settlers are attacking villages around the town, the army is here practically every night.” He fears for the future in Bethlehem, where his restaurant Fawda drew visitors for almost a decade to eat innovative versions of classic Palestinian cuisine, before it closed during the pandemic. Its November reopening has been put on hold, and Kattan has also paused the opening of his new six-room boutique hotel, Kassa. Bethlehem received as many as 2.5 million tourists a year before the pandemic, welcoming everyone from pilgrims to artists – including many who came to sample Kattan’s food – but seven months of war, he said, had devastated the city’s economy. Palestinians are no longer able to cross the checkpoints into Israel for work, while thousands more are out of work because of the dip in tourism.
“All hospitality businesses have taken a hit in Bethlehem without exception,” he said. “Restaurants in the centre of the city are either shut down or are now opening at most two days a week. This is partly about tourism, but also people can’t afford it. Who in Bethlehem can afford grilled meat and mezes in a restaurant? Not many.” The four generations of the Natsheh family, who run the butcher’s where Kattan used to buy lamb for Fawda, tell him that people who used to come in and spend their weekly wages from work in Israel are rarely able to afford meat. One customer who used to buy cuts of beef entrecote almost every day now buys five slices once a week. As Kattan scours the market for ingredients and greets familiar faces, he encounters more stories of loss. A visit to a local baker means consoling him about his son, 27-year-old Hazem Nabil Danna, who suffocated to death inside a bakery in a nearby village after Israeli soldiers raided the area. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said there was “no direct connection between the IDF activity in the area and the death”, but that they were awaiting the results of an autopsy “for a thorough examination of the circumstances of his death”. Kattan tries to temper his anger at Danna’s death while selecting spices from a shop he visited with his grandmother as a child, which should be lined with chocolate Easter eggs but instead is far more subdued, a few eggs clustered on one shelf. He pulls out a pungent jar of cloves and points out sumac from Hebron and thyme from Jenin. From olive oil producers to salt sellers and winemakers, people across the territory are increasingly reluctant to transport their goods. At Kattan’s favourite shop for vinegary pickles and jars of tahini, Samer Daoudi, the owner, said he rarely travelled to his home town of Nablus, unlike before the war when he went each week.
For Kattan, showcasing Palestinian cuisine at his restaurant Akub in west London, and the launch of his forthcoming book are about maintaining a connection with land increasingly under threat. “There is systematic destruction of heritage happening in Gaza … I really feel we are disappearing,” he said. Across the West Bank, he added, “the lands are disappearing and the farmlands are being attacked. “Part of what has happened since 7 October has meant seeing a total dehumanisation of who we are. That’s how I rationalise talking about food, wine, art and culture, to say we are here, we have fantastic wine- and spirit-makers, food and chefs – a society that’s diverse and has been here for centuries.” Knowing that people across the world will make the food in his book means that even with Palestinian farmlands under threat, cooking and eating the dishes they normally yield breathes life into the culture. “For me the book brings hope,” said Kattan. “A cookbook makes these things that could be gone contemporary. People cooking these recipes is a way to keep the culture alive.” • Bethlehem: A Celebration of Palestinian Food, by Fadi Kattan, is published on 15 May by Hardie Grant at £28.

98,,"Anton* was on his way to work as a civilian volunteer in the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv 10 days ago. Several men stopped him. They asked: “Hi, who are you?” And: “Can you show me your documents please?” One of the officers produced a tablet and scrolled down a list. He found Anton’s name. A single word was written next to it in red capital letters: ukhyliant, or draft dodger. The men took him to the nearest conscription office. That morning, Anton and his colleague Serhii were due to drive a truck full of humanitarian aid to a frontline zone. The two men – aged 32 and 31 – had been checked twice before, once outside a metro station, and on a second occasion while waiting for a tram. They received pieces of paper. The first was a polite request to register details. The second an official summons to report to a recruiting centre as soon as possible. More than two years into Vladimir Putin’s full-scale invasion, Ukraine’s armed forces are short of soldiers. Russian troops in February captured the city of Avdiivka and in recent weeks they have been advancing further in the east of the country, besieging the town of Chasiv Yar. Ukrainian commanders acknowledge Moscow has more troops, but say the decisive factor is its superior artillery, as well as war planes, used to pound defences.
Nevertheless, the army is trying to find new people to replace those who have been killed or injured and to relieve exhausted soldiers propping up the frontline. In spring 2022 volunteers queued to joined up, but with the war stretching on indefinitely, there are few eager recruits. Measures allowing the military to call up more soldiers and to tighten punishment for evasion were approved by Volodymyr Zelenskiy in April. The mobilisation age was reduced from 27 to 25 and, from 18 May, draft evaders can lose their driving licence and have their bank accounts frozen and property seized. The government has also said it is withdrawing consular services from Ukrainian men living abroad in countries such as Poland and Lithuania. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, admitted that few were likely to come home but he said it was a symbolic move as “guys in the trenches are very tired” while their counterparts in the rest of Europe were “sitting in restaurants”. With draft officers roaming the streets of Ukrainian towns and cities, some men of conscription age are hiding. Telegram channels have sprung up where users can report sightings of state representatives in order to avoid them. Posts are written in a simple meteorological code. The officers are dubbed “clouds” or “rain”. A typical exchange goes: “What is the weather like at Defenders of Ukraine metro station?” Answer: “Three clouds have covered a young guy.” At the Kharkiv conscription centre, meanwhile, Anton explained he was a volunteer doing useful NGO work. The military official interviewing him was unimpressed. He told Anton he had to appear within three days before a medical commission, which would assess whether he was fit to join the army. If he didn’t turn up he faced a 5,100 hryvnia (£100) fine. “There was hate in his eyes. He was a Dalek. He emphasised Ukraine has been fighting Russia since 2014,” Anton’s friend Serhii said. The official said that if Anton didn’t want to serve, he could swim across the Tisa river to Romania, one of several routes used by draft evaders. Or he could “tunnel” to the Russian city of Belgorod. “It was a joke but not a joke,” Serhii said. Instead, Anton vanished. He moved to a village. Now he works remotely. “I love my country. But I can’t kill anyone and I don’t want to die,” Serhii said. He added: “Everyone is tired of war. And of this government. There’s an attitude of: ‘Go fuck yourself.’”
Oleksandr – a 36-year-old IT manager – said he rarely went out. He avoided public transport, travelling only by car. He moved to a wealthy neighbourhood of Kyiv because draft officers preferred to operate in poorer districts, where it was easier to catch evaders, he said. Some of the apartment owners in his block were members of parliament. “The military don’t visit here. Our compound is an island of survival. To be poor in Ukraine is to be dead,” said Oleksandr’s wife, Nastia. Nastia said she worried about her husband and suffered from panic attacks. “We’ve been married for 12 years. We are one organism. If he dies I will die too. Maybe I will kill myself,” she said. The couple paid taxes, were “100% Ukrainian” and bought a prosthesis for a soldier who lost a leg. But they believed Ukraine should negotiate with Russia, even though Putin was a “madman”, they said. “I feel a slave. You have one life. If it’s a choice between life and flag I choose life,” Oleksandr said. In October 2023 one of their friends, Myroslav, fled Ukraine on foot. He bought a map for $500 (£400), paying on a crypto site, and trekked for 24 hours to Hungary, across fields and through a forest. Myroslav said he only took with him a small backpack. At one point he spotted a patrol and lay down in the grass for 40 minutes. He crawled through a hole in a border fence. Then he went to a Hungarian police station. Myroslav is now in Warsaw. “I didn’t want to fight. I’m afraid to die,” he said. Others pay local smugglers to show them the route. The going rate is $5,000 to $15,000 per person. Another option is to pay a bribe to obtain a medical exemption certificate and to exit via normal channels. About half of those who try to escape – 40,000 people, up to summer 2023 – get caught. Some drown. On Saturday the state border service said its guards found the bodies of two men who tried to swim across the Tisa river.
Fedir Venislavskyi, a deputy and member of the national security committee, said the number of would-be escapers was smaller than in 2022, when 6 million refugees left. “We have a problem with conscription. But it’s not huge and it should not be exaggerated,” he said. “Russia is trying to blow up the issue for propaganda reasons.” A “few dozens” of men tried to cross illegally, he acknowledged. “People are afraid. Fear makes them do stupid things.” Venislavskyi said the government had no easy options. Moscow has 470,000 to 500,000 troops fighting at the frontline and was seeking to mobilise another 500,000. It offered a $7,000 sign-on fee to new recruits: a fortune for men from deprived areas, he said. Ukraine had to respond by boosting its reserves “by a few hundred thousand”. A professor of constitutional law, Venislavskyi fought Russia in 2014. He saidonly a handful of colleagues from his university had volunteered so far. Conscription has radically changed the nature of Ukrainian society. In the capital there appear to be more women on the streets than men, mostly students and older officer workers. Masha Lavrova, a 24-year-old TikTok producer, said the “number of guys had dropped” off since 2023, when she came back to Ukraine after eight years abroad. She said it was difficult to find suitable matches on dating apps such as Tinder, with so many potential dates serving in the armed forces.
“When I open Tinder near the frontline I get thousands of likes. My telephone loses charge. In Kyiv it’s different,” she said. “I think many guys are quite depressed. You feel guilty for living. It’s hard to do anything that’s not about survival or Ukraine’s victory.” She said that some men pretended the war was not happening, with one telling her he didn’t want to “waste his energy”. “It seems a lot of guys with values that align with mine are somewhere else,” she said. Olha – a 34-year-old living near Kharkiv – said her husband didn’t want to fight because they have two small children and household debts. An IT programmer, he is “at home 24/7”. When he had to see a dentist they researched back routes to get there, including one “through the woods”, she recalled. “Before 2022 we went to the cinema, holidayed in Spain and travelled. Now we go nowhere. My husband’s brother is in the army. He tells him every time ‘you don’t need this shit’,” she said. Her husband felt “ashamed” that he was not participating in the war. She explained: “He met a friend who is in the army. They were joking. But I could see he felt uncomfortable that this man went and he didn’t.” She added: “The problem is now we are in some bubble. Yes, rockets are flying. But in our small town it’s not so bad. That’s why many people are sitting at home and trying to avoid going to the army. Many don’t give a shit. They are living their lives as normal.” *Some names have been changed",,2024-05-04 05:00:32+00:00,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/may/04/i-love-my-country-but-i-cant-kill-ukrainian-men-evading-conscription,The Guardian
99,,"China’s president, Xi Jinping, is to visit Europe next week for the first time in five years, in a tour that will take in the unlikely trifecta of France, Hungary and Serbia. The visit comes as China pushes to avoid a trade war with the EU, while attitudes towards Beijing in the bloc are hardening after multiple spying scandals and China’s ongoing support for Russia in the war in Ukraine. Xi’s first stop will be Paris. On Monday, he will meet the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen. “The Chinese leadership is pretty clear about what they want,” says Abigaël Vasselier, the director of foreign relations at Merics, a German thinktank focused on China. Xi would be focused on lobbying against the EU’s anti-subsidy probes, particularly on electric vehicles (EVs) and on stabilising the bilateral relationship, Vasselier said. In September, in remarks widely understood as being directed at China, von der Leyen said that global markets were “flooded with cheaper electric cars … [whose] price is kept artificially low by huge state subsidies”. The probe has caused widespread consternation in Beijing, which sees it as unfair and politically motivated. On Thursday, the European Commission’s trade chief hinted that tariffs on Chinese EVs could be imposed by June, after the launch of an investigation into state support for electric car manufacturing in China. The deadline for any measures to be imposed is 4 July. China “cannot afford to have more and more restrictions to the European market”, Vasselier says, but at the same time, “China does not have an offer for Europe at this point”. That is because one of Europe’s – and Macron’s – longstanding asks of China is for Xi to put pressure on Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, to end the war in Ukraine. “Two years into the war, the Europeans have realised … this is not going to happen,” says Vasselier. Prof Shen Dingli, a Shanghai-based international relations scholar, says that for China, the question of Taiwan was more important than that of Ukraine.
Macron, von der Leyen and Xi last met in person in April last year when the Europeans flew to Beijing. Macron, who arrived with a 50-strong business delegation and left with 18 cooperation agreements inked between French and Chinese companies, caused a storm on that trip when he told reporters that Europe should not become “America’s followers” on the Taiwan issue. The US president, Joe Biden, has repeatedly said that the US would defend Taiwan militarily in the event of an attempted Chinese annexation.
“When the French president visited China last year … he made it very clear: on the question of Taiwan, France should have its own independent position,” Shen says. “China appreciates his position.” Xi and Macron’s personal rapport was burnished last year when the Chinese president took his French counterpart on a rare personal trip to Guangzhou, a city in southern China. Next week, Macron will return the favour with a visit to Hautes-Pyrénées, a mountainous region of France. But despite Xi and Macron’s personal chemistry, “Chinese Communist party leaders don’t have friends. They have interests,” says Charles Parton, a senior associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute and a former British diplomat in China. “It’s a way of ruthlessly pushing forward your own interests.” “Wherever China sees benefit from dealing with Europe as a whole, then it does. When it sees the benefit of dealing with individuals, sometimes because it undermines the whole, then it deals with individuals,” Parton says.
The EU’s investigation into alleged state support into the car industry is one of a series ordered by Brussels into supplies to Europe including medical devices and wind turbines, which are being sold at 50% of the cost of those made in Europe – long considered the lead in the sector. China argues that the trade investigations are politically motivated and the only loser in a tariff war would be the consumer. The emphasis on bilateral relations comes as China’s relationship with the bloc is increasingly strained. There are also concerns in the EU about disinformation and foreign interference, with the arrest of an assistant to the German AfD MEP Maximilian Krah on suspicion of spying for the Chinese. On 24 April, the Dutch and Polish offices of the Chinese security equipment company Nuctech were raided by EU competition regulators as part of a new anti-foreign subsidy investigation. The move, which was directed by the European Commission, was immediately condemned by China’s commerce ministry. Tariffs on EVs will be even more troubling for Beijing. Last year, EU imports of EVs from China reached $11.5bn, according to Rhodium Group.
Xi will also be visiting one of his closest allies in Europe, Hungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orbán. China-Hungary relations have become increasingly close in recent years. In February, China offered to deepen law enforcement ties with Hungary, taking its already cosy relationship beyond the economic realm and into a security cooperation agreement that sparked concern in other EU countries. Hungary is already Huawei’s largest base outside China, and the country will soon host carmaker BYD’s first European factory. In return, Orbán has been a vocal supporter of China in international forums. On several occasions, Hungary has opposed EU motions critical of China on human rights. The most symbolic stop on the tour will be Xi’s visit to Belgrade, around the 25th anniversary of the US’s bombing of the Chinese embassy in the Serbian capital. The incident, in which three Chinese journalists were killed, caused a huge spike in anti-US sentiment in China. It also hardened China’s hostility to Nato, as the strike happened during the alliance’s bombing of Yugoslavia. China’s hostility to Nato is part of the reason why Beijing has maintained its support for Moscow since the invasion of Ukraine. Xi’s visit will “remind the world that although China and Serbia are geographically separated by the Eurasian continent, they share the same security interests. We need to strengthen our cooperation to overcome the security threats from the US and Nato,” Shen says. The Belgrade visit is not as strategically important as the meetings in Paris and Budapest. But, says Parton, “it fitted the timetable. And it sure as hell fits their intentions and interests in highlighting American behaviour.”",,2024-05-04 04:00:30+00:00,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/may/04/xi-jinping-visit-france-hungary-serbia-eu-trade-tariff-row,The Guardian
100,,"Canadian police have charged three members of an alleged hit team for their role in the assassination of the Sikh activist Hardeep Singh Nijjar, the first arrests in a high-profile killing that officials believe was masterminded by India. The arrests come nearly a year after the prominent activist was killed in the parking lot of the Guru Nanak Sikh gurdwara on the evening of 18 June in the city of Surrey, British Columbia. In what investigators previously described as a carefully orchestrated operation, two assailants fired about 50 bullets at Nijjar and escaped the area in a grey car. According to court documents, Karanpreet Singh, 28, Kamalpreet Singh, 22, and Karan Brar, 22, have been charged with first-degree murder and one count of conspiracy to commit murder in Nijjar’s death. The three men arrested on Friday were living in the city of Edmonton, Alberta, and will be transported on Monday to British Columbia to face charges. The indictments allege the conspiracy was planned in both Surrey and Edmonton between 1 May and 18 June. Brian Edwards, Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) assistant commissioner, called the killing “outrageous” and “reprehensible”, adding that the investigators worked closely with members of the Sikh community. “It had a profound impact on the residents of Surrey and, notwithstanding today the announcing of charges, those scars will remain in our community for a long time,” he said. In September, the prime minister, Justin Trudeau, told parliament his government had “credible allegations” that India was behind the killing, calling the death of a Canadian citizen on Canadian soil an “unacceptable violation of our sovereignty”. India has denied direct involvement in the killing of Nijjar and suggested “rogue” operatives were behind a separate attempted assassination of a prominent Sikh figure in the United States. The fallout from Nijjar’s murder has chilled relations between Canada and India – and exposed what officials say is a transnational campaign of violence by India, meant to target dissidents abroad. On Friday, the Indian high commissioner, Sanjay Kumar Verma, declined to comment on the arrests, calling them an “internal” matter for Canada. Canada’s public safety minister said the arrests confirmed “that the RCMP take these matters extremely seriously”. “While today’s action by Canadian authorities, which led to the arrest of those directly involved in the killing, is a step forward, it only scratches the surface,” Gurpatwant Pannun, himself the target of a failed assassination attempt, said in a statement. He also called on Canadian police to pursue the intelligence agents and diplomats allegedly involved in the killing in order to “dismantle the networks that enable and perpetuate such crimes against Canadians on Canadian soil”. The men arrested on Friday are Indian citizens who entered Canada on student visas three to five years ago. None has permanent residency, said Supt Mandeep Mooker. More arrests in connection with the murder are possible, he said, adding that police were working with other units in “active investigations” across the country. Six men and two vehicles were involved in Nijjar’s murder, according to previous statements from police. “We remain dedicated to finding and arresting each one of these individuals,” said Mooker. The CBC reported police were investigating three other murders in Canada, including the “sick and twisted” killing of an 11-year-old boy in the city of Edmonton. The World Sikh Organization said in a statement the charges raised “disturbing questions about the nexus between the government of India and criminal gangs”. Assistant commissioner David Teboul, commander of the Federal Policing Program in the Pacific region, told reporters that the shooting of Nijjar was “very much under active investigation … and these efforts include investigating connections to the government of India”. He said it had been “challenging and difficult” working with Indian officials in Canada and counterpart agencies in India.",,2024-05-03 17:04:03+00:00,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/may/03/suspect-hardeep-singh-nijjar-assassination-canada,The Guardian
101,,"The retraction of three peer-reviewed articles prominently cited in court cases on the so-called abortion pill – mifepristone – has put a group of papers by anti-abortion researchers in the scientific limelight. Seventeen sexual and reproductive health researchers are calling for four peer-reviewed studies by anti-abortion researchers to be retracted or amended. The papers, critics contend, are “fatally flawed” and muddy the scientific consensus for courts and lawmakers who lack the scientific training to understand their methodological problems.
While some papers date back to 2002, the group argues that now – in the post-Roe v Wade era – the stakes have never been higher. State and federal courts now routinely field cases on near-total abortion bans, attacks on in vitro fertilization and attempts to give fetuses the rights of people. “When we saw the meta-analysis presented again and again and again – in the briefs to the Dobbs case” that overturned Roe v Wade “and state cases” to restrict abortion, “the concerns really rose,” said Julia Littell, a retired Bryn Mawr professor and social researcher with expertise in statistical analysis. A meta-analysis is a kind of research that uses statistical methods to combine studies on the same topic. Researchers sometimes use these analyses to examine the scientific consensus on a subject. Littell was “shocked” by a paper that said women experience dramatic increases in mental health problems after an abortion – primarily because of the paper’s research methods. Of the 22 studies cited by the meta-analysis, 11 were by the lone author of the paper itself. The meta-analysis “failed to meet any published methodological criteria for systematic reviews” and failed to follow recommendations to avoid statistical dependencies, according to a criticism published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ). Large scientific bodies have found no evidence to suggest abortion causes increases in mental health problems. The best predictor of a woman’s mental health after an abortion is her health before. What’s more, there is substantial evidence that women who are denied a wanted abortion suffer both mental and financial harms. From the time it was published, this 2011 meta-analysis has drawn consternation. Still, it remains in the scientific record in a dispute that the 17 authors of the BMJ criticism, including Littell, say goes beyond mere scientific disagreement. The paper has been cited in at least 24 federal and state court cases and 14 parliamentary hearings in six countries. Chelsea Polis, a reproductive health scientist in New York City, who helped gather the group of academics, says her “concerns with the meta-analysis on abortion and mental health published … are based on it being, in my professional opinion, egregiously methodologically flawed”. The researcher who wrote the article, Priscilla Coleman, a retired professor from Bowling Green State University in Ohio, has responded to calls for retractions with legal threats and descriptions of conspiracy. She said calls for retraction were “an organized effort to cull professional literature and remove studies demonstrating abortion increases risk of mental health problems to impact the legal status of abortion”. Since the supreme court overturned the constitutional right to abortion and allowed 21 states to severely restrict or ban the procedure, a series of retractions and investigations show how the scientific community is slowly beginning to re-evaluate work cited in these court cases. “We’re seeing claims made with legal force behind them, and that’s causing people to look at a lot of this research in a different way,” said Mary Ziegler, a professor of law at the University of California at Davis, and an expert on the history of reproduction. A second author whose work is at the center of the BMJ critique is David C Reardon, a longtime abortion opponent. A 2002 study by Reardon, also published in BMJ, is now under investigation. BMJ said in a statement that the “issue remains under consideration by our research integrity team”, and that their final decision would be made “public once we have completed our internal process”. Reardon trained as an engineer, but found his calling in research that claimed a connection between abortion and poor mental health. He founded the Elliot Institute in Illinois, an openly anti-abortion non-profit, to pursue that research. Today, Reardon is affiliated with the Charlotte Lozier Institute, funded by one of the most powerful anti-abortion campaign organizations in the US, Susan B Anthony Pro-Life America. Reardon also co-authored two of the articles that were retracted before supreme court hearings, both by a colleague at the Lozier Institute. Reardon did not respond to multiple requests for comment. According to analyses of the literature and experts such as Julia Steinberg, an associate professor of family science at the University of Maryland School of Public Health and a co-author of a recent critique of these studies in BMJ, the science is not in dispute. The “rates of mental health problems for women with an unwanted pregnancy were the same whether they had an abortion or gave birth”, an analysis by the UK’s National Collaborating Center for Mental Health found in 2011. That review was cited as one of the best by the US National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine, in its own 2018 review of the issue. Other reviews, such as one from 2009 by the American Psychological Association, found that evidence “did not support the claim that observed associations between abortion and mental health problems are caused by abortion per se”.
“One can be pro-choice or pro-abortion or anti-abortion, but still understand what the science says with respect to abortion and mental health,” said Steinberg. Although matters of scientific integrity may seem academic, they can have concrete impacts on policy in the US post-Roe. One of the few cases of scientific retractions to break through to the wider public was in Texas, where a federal court relied heavily on two studies in a decision to invalidate the approval of mifepristone – better known as the “abortion pill”. The case was appealed all the way to the supreme court, where it was heard in March in oral arguments in Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine v FDA. Just weeks before the justices were set to hear the case, and as nearly the entire scientific community screamed about the “junk science” at its heart, the heavily cited studies were retracted by Sage Publications. Even so, the article’s claims remained in briefs before the court, and were cited as evidence by one of the most conservative justices, Samuel Alito. Like Reardon, Coleman also recently had a paper retracted, this one in Frontiers in Psychology in 2022. The journal said publicly that the paper “did not meet the standards for publication”. Notably, one of the paper’s reviewers also worked at the Lozier Institute. Coleman took legal action against the journal over its decision to retract. The court ruled against Coleman in March 2023, Frontiers said. Coleman’s 2011 meta-analysis, published in the British Journal of Psychiatry, was also involved in a heated retraction fight in the UK. The first calls for retraction of the article came soon after it was published in 2012. It was again brought to journal editors in 2022 after the BJP established a research integrity group. “Motivated by strong agreement with” the importance of scientific integrity, said Polis, “I led a group of 16 scholars to summarize and submit our concerns, again, about the Coleman meta-analysis to BJP.” In response to these concerns, the BJP established an independent panel of experts to investigate. The panel recommended Coleman’s article be retracted, but was overruled by the Royal College of Psychiatrists, the professional association that publishes the BJP. The move prompted members of the independent panel and some editorial board members to resign. Later reporting that appeared in the BMJ included panel members saying they believed the college declined to retract because they may not have had comprehensive legal cover in the United States. Coleman threatened to sue – twice – according to letters obtained by the BBC. Although Coleman denied that her legal threats contributed to the BJP’s decision not to retract her study, she said help from attorneys had been important to defending her work. “I have spent the last two years vigorously defending three of my own articles and without the financial means to hire highly competent lawyers and the time and opportunity to write lengthy rebuttals, the impact could have been very damaging,” said Coleman. The Royal College of Psychiatrists responded to inquiries from the Guardian by sending a 2023 statement on its decision. That statement read, in part: “After careful consideration, given the distance in time since the original article was published, the widely available public debate on the paper, including the letters of complaint already available alongside the article online, and the fact that the article has already been subject to a full investigation, it has been decided to reject the request for the article to be retracted.” The statement added: “We now regard this matter as closed.” Coleman has also defended her BJP meta-analysis when she testified in US courts, including in a Michigan hearing in which she said her study was “absolutely not” retracted. Steinberg said: “That’s what’s really infuriating.” Coleman “hasn’t even had to admit that she made an error”, she added.
Researchers also called for retraction of a 2009 article in the Journal of Psychiatric Research by Coleman and the anti-abortion activists Catherine Coyle and Vincent Rue. This article too has been under fire for years and even publicly debunked. In spite of apparent flaws, Coleman included this 2009 article in her meta-analysis, which critics say compounds the errors. Additionally, authors of the BMJ critique called for a 2005 article in the Journal of Anxiety Disorders by Coleman, Reardon and a Florida State University psychology professor, Jesse Cougle, to be accompanied by an expression of concern. Ivan Oransky, one of the founders of the Retraction Watch blog, said that although retractions had become more common, they were nowhere near common enough to correct the scientific record. About one in 500 papers is retracted today, but perhaps as many as one in 50 ought to be, he said. “All it does is further throw into question what the heck value these multibillion-dollar publishing companies are adding,” said Oransky. For critics of the scientific publishing industry, like Oransky, the response shows how flawed studies cited by courts are a “symptom” of problems with publishers, rather than a failure of courts. To Littell, the solution is in plain sight: “We really need to be publishing fewer papers, better work, better science.” This article was amended on 3 May 2024 to clarify the action taken by Priscilla Coleman against Frontiers, and to clarify which work was at issue in the Michigan hearing.",,2024-04-28 12:00:03+00:00,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/apr/28/junk-science-papers-abortion-cases,The Guardian
102,,"At the Jerusalem theatre on Thursday night, concertgoers and staff expressed a mixture of anger, sadness and defiance as weeks of pro-Palestinian protests across dozens of US college campuses reached a tumultuous climax 6,000 miles away. The noisy demonstrations have been closely followed in Israel, reported by major media and discussed by prominent public figures. Idan Degani, a security guard at the theatre, said many in Israel viewed the protests with confusion and anxiety, seeing them as an attack on the country and not just its government. “We didn’t know so many people hated Israel. I don’t think these young people know a lot about Israel or about the conflict. I think the older people do, but not this younger generation,” the 28-year-old said, as he watched late arrivals hurry for a programme of Haydn and Schubert. “I certainly don’t think it will change how anyone here sees the war.”
Such feelings appear widespread among the Jewish majority in Israel, seven months after war was triggered by surprise attacks launched by Hamas into the south of the country in which about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, were killed and 250 taken hostage. “We thought we understood how much hate there was out there. I mean, I’m a child of Holocaust survivors, but it’s still such a shock. It makes it unbelievably real,” said Danae Marx, a public relations specialist at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem. Many are deeply critical of the country’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and the far-right ministers in his coalition government, but Jewish Israelis interviewed by the Guardian this week blame outrage overseas on misinformation, ignorance, historical hostility from international institutions such as the UN, global “double standards” and entrenched antisemitism. “At the beginning people took these demonstrations pretty lightly … but now they are seen as evidence of how the progressive camp in liberal democracies can take over the public agenda and use it to attack Israel or whatever Israel does,” said Prof Tamar Hermann, a political scientist at the Israel Democracy Institute in Jerusalem. “People see that [protesters] put all Israelis in the same basket and [there is] so much false information that even opponents of the [current Israeli] government can’t accept it. They are united in their resentment of these protests abroad.” In the right-leaning Jerusalem Post, the commentator David Weinberg wrote that “unbalanced criticism” of Israel was not new.
“Long before Benjamin Netanyahu, [far right coalition partners] Itamar Ben-Gvir, and Bezalel Smotrich were anywhere near the Israeli government, the world was fiercely critical of Israel. Rarely have Western pundits shown understanding for [Israeli military] operations against Palestinian terrorists,” he wrote. An article in the left-leaning Haaretz newspaper on Wednesday described “Columbia’s entitled squatters and the Manhattan version of air-dropped aid”. Analysts said the perceived downplaying of evidence of sexual abuse suffered by Israelis during the 7 October attack and accusations that Israel was committing genocide – a staple of chants and posters at recent US protests – had shocked many Israelis, particularly on the left. More than 34,600 people have died in Gaza in the Israeli military offensive, mostly women and children, according to local health authorities. The offensive has laid waste to much of the territory and caused an acute humanitarian crisis, threatening famine. The international court of justice called on Israel in January to act to prevent genocidal acts in Gaza and allow aid into the territory. Many in Israel have attributed the accusation of genocide to antisemitism and see the slogan “from the river to the sea, Palestine will be free” as a call for the destruction of Israel. Protesters have repeatedly denied the charge of using hate speech. Netanyahu recorded a video statement last month about the protests on US campuses, telling Israelis that “antisemitic mobs have taken over leading universities”. “They call for the annihilation of Israel. They attack Jewish students,” he said. Observers said the growing diplomatic isolation of Israel and increasingly strained relations with the US had reinforced a historical sense among Jewish Israelis that their country had no reliable allies or protectors, which was connected to collective memories about persecution of the Jewish people over millennia. On Thursday Netanyahu met Holocaust survivors who will participate next week in the opening ceremony of the annual memorial day commemorating the more than six million Jews killed by the Nazis. “If we need to stand alone, we will stand alone. If it is possible to recruit the nations of the world, how much the better. But if we do not defend ourselves nobody will defend us,” Netanyahu said afterwards. His office released a quote on Friday from Itzhak Kabilio, an 88-year old Holocaust survivor from Yugoslavia: “Today, the state of Israel is the one and only haven of the Jewish people. If somebody ever thinks that the USA could be a haven, with what is happening there today, we see that it is no longer the case. Therefore, we must strengthen the state.” On Jerusalem’s Jaffa Street at 11pm on Thursday night, teenagers sat outside cafes, filled bars and ate ice-cream. Some spoke of friends in the US who had described a “terrible situation” on campuses.
Joseph, 21, an off-duty soldier who had recently immigrated to Israel from the UK and preferred not to give his surname, said protesters in the US were misinformed. “Everyone has the right to protest and to voice their views, but I don’t think they have the full picture of what is actually happening here and in Gaza,” he said. “When it comes to antisemitism or anti-Zionism, it’s often pretty hard to tell the difference. If you hate the Jewish state, then you hate Jews.” Jewish Israelis constitute just under three-quarters of the population of 9.3 million, and attitudes to the war, as well as pro-Palestinian protests overseas, are different among Palestinian Israelis. The protests in the US are part of a movement to force educational institutions to divest from businesses that support the war in Gaza and reflect how the war has become a major flashpoint in US politics. Since the campaign against Hamas began, the US has been one of Israel’s staunchest allies, providing substantial military support, including most recently in a $15bn aid package. At the Jerusalem theatre, many concertgoers described the current war as one of many that Israel would have to fight over coming decades. “Jews are stupid … For hundreds of years it’s been like this and we always think it will get better but it never does,” said Joseph Avi Cohen, a retired bank manager. “We need to be stronger. We need to fight back. It’s in the Bible. If someone hits you, you hit them back, twice as hard, 10 times as hard.”",,2024-05-03 16:50:52+00:00,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/may/03/israelis-voice-sadness-and-defiance-over-gaza-protests-on-us-campuses,The Guardian
103,,"Germany has summoned a top Russian envoy over a series of cyber-attacks targeting members of the governing Social Democrats and its defence and technology sector. The 2023 attacks, in which several websites were knocked offline in apparent response to Berlin’s decision to send tanks to Ukraine, have been blamed on a hacker group linked to Russian military intelligence. It exploited a then unknown vulnerability in the Microsoft Outlook email service and, according to German officials, compromised the servers of affected companies. “Today we can say unambiguously [that] we can attribute this cyber-attack to a group called APT28, which is steered by the military intelligence service of Russia,” the German foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, told a news conference during a visit to Australia. “In other words, it was a state-sponsored Russian cyber-attack on Germany, and this is absolutely intolerable and unacceptable and will have consequences.” The Czech Republic said its institutions had also been targeted. “Czechia has long been targeted by the APT28. Such violations are in violation of UN norms of responsible state behaviour,” a foreign ministry statement said. APT28, also known as Fancy Bear or Pawn Storm, has been accused of dozens of cyber-attacks in countries around the world. The UK’s National Cyber Security Centre has described the unit as “a highly skilled threat actor” that has “used tools including X-Tunnel, X-Agent and CompuTrace to penetrate target networks”. Germany’s interior ministry said a series of cyber-attacks attributable to the Russian military intelligence service GRU had also targeted the country’s logistics, defence, aerospace and IT sectors, exploiting the vulnerability in Microsoft Outlook in order to compromise email accounts. “The Russian cyber-attacks are a threat to our democracy, which we are resolutely countering,” said the interior minister, Nancy Faeser, adding that Germany was acting alongside the EU and Nato. “Under no circumstances will we allow ourselves to be intimidated by the Russian regime.” She said it was particularly critical to counter such attacks from Russia ahead of the European elections in June. The EU on Friday condemned the “irresponsible” cyber-attacks on Germany and the Czech Republic, revealing that “state institutions, agencies and entities in member states, including in Poland, Lithuania, Slovakia and Sweden have been targeted by the same threat actor before”. Nato condemned the “malicious” attacks and said they were a reminder that “cyber threat actors persistently seek to destabilise the alliance”. The summoning of an ambassador or high-ranking official is considered a strong diplomatic tool. A spokesperson for the German foreign ministry said the acting chargé d’affaires had been invited to attend a meeting as the incident shows “that the Russian threat to security and peace in Europe is real and it is enormous” Germany was at the time of the attack in 2023 inching towards a decision to send Leopold 2 battle tanks to the frontline after Ukraine appealed for a fleet of 300 from Europe. The EU’s computer security response unit, Cert-EU, last year noted a German media report that an SPD executive had been targeted in a cyber-attack in January 2023 “resulting in possible data exposure”. Berlin also said Russian activist hackers had knocked several German websites offline in response to its decision to send tanks to Ukraine, although with little tangible effect. The pro-Russia hacking group Killnet took credit for the attack at the time, with the Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, saying: “We are not aware of what [Killnet] is. We honestly wonder why any group of hackers is associated with Russia and not with some other European country.” Cyber-attacks are officially considered by European leaders to be part of Russia’s “hybrid” war against Ukraine and the EU. Disinformation across social media and doppelganger or fake news websites that look almost exactly like legitimate media are part of the weaponry deployed by the Kremlin, with more than 17,000 disinformation units identified by the EU since the start of the war. The pro-Russian doppelganger network of sites was uncovered in 2022 and is still active. In April, a fake Der Spiegel website claimed the German finance minister, Christian Lindner, was “robbing” pensioners. The EU’s chief diplomat, Josep Borrell, said earlier this year that Russia was using disinformation to undermine the credibility of mainstream parties, sow seeds of distrust in democracy and create hate against minorities. He said this new kind of warfare “does not involve bombs that kill you” but words and ideas that “colonise you”. The World Economic Forum ranked disinformation and cyber-attacks – so-called foreign information manipulations and interference – as “the second biggest risk the world is going to face this year”, while Nato said it was treating it as being as important as physical weaponry. Baerbock’s comments come two months after Russian media published an audio recording of a meeting of senior German military officials, after one participant had dialled in through an “unauthorised connection” leading to the leak. Germany has said it will work with EU countries on potential sanctions against any new people working with APT28, which was previously sanctioned after an attack on the Bundestag in 2015.",,2024-05-03 08:28:26+00:00,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/may/03/germany-says-russians-behind-intolerable-cyber-attack-last-year,The Guardian
104,,"Jack, 22, a student in public administration, was dragged out of his university building by the arms and legs on Friday, as police forcibly removed several dozen students who had been occupying Paris’s Sciences Po university overnight in a protest against civilian deaths in Gaza. “We’ll keep going,” said the French-American student in his final year at the prestigious political science school, whose alumni include the president, Emmanuel Macron. “This is about speaking out against a genocide, it’s an international movement. We occupied the building peacefully.” Sciences Po has become the focal point of French student protests over the war in Gaza and academic ties with Israel. The protests, much smaller in scale than those seen in the US, began at elite political science faculties, but have spread to other universities in recent days. “I simply don’t want my government to be complicit in this genocide in my name,” said Jack, who slept in his clothes on a Sciences Po lecture hall floor on Thursday, having spent the evening with dozens of others holding discussion groups while also revising for exams next week.
About 10 Sciences Po students began a hunger strike in protest at deaths in Gaza on Thursday. In the smart street on Paris’s Left Bank, Palestinian flags hung from the university windows alongside a banner saying: “Hunger strike for Gaza”, until police moved in to clear the sit-in at the request of university authorities, following the failure of hours of talks. “Those on hunger strike are doing OK, they’re being monitored by doctors and they will keep going,” said Jack, who did not give his surname. He said it was “lies and entirely wrong” to say there was any antisemitism in the movement, saying it was for peace and against civilian deaths. The government in France – which is home to the largest Jewish population outside Israel and the US, and to Europe’s largest Muslim population – has said it would be extremely firm and stop any blockades and sit-ins. Some university heads have called in police to clear buildings. The protests are happening against the backdrop of the European elections, with the government minister for higher education accusing the leftwing party France Unbowed (La France Insoumise) and its leader, Jean-Luc Mélenchon, of stoking the protests for its own electoral gains. The party said the protesting students were the “honour” of France. Students from several universities gathered to protest outside the Pantheon in Paris on Friday, some of whom had been evicted from sit-ins and occupations.
Mathilde, 18, a first-year student in social and economic administration at Paris University’s Tolbiac faculty, occupied a university courtyard this week before being moved by security guards. “We’re simply trying to give voice to those facing violence in Gaza; to put the spotlight on a genocide,” she said. “But when we talk about Palestine, there’s repression. We’re infantilised or demonised and we’re not being listened to. This is not pro-Hamas, I’ve never met anyone antisemitic, we just want peace.” Her parents, from Paris, were broadly supportive, she said. It was her second big demonstration after she took part in protests against Macron’s pension policy changes while still at school. Leonore, 18, a philosophy student, said: “We have to cause maximum disruption in order to be heard and not ignored.” Hania Hamidi, a student in sociology at Paris University and spokesperson for France’s Unef students’ union, said: “For several weeks, we’ve seen an increase in repression. Police have entered our centres of learning, debates have been held behind closed doors. We’re asking for peace in the world. Universities are a place for debate. And instead we’re seeing a muzzling of youth. There has been too much repression.” A few streets away, a Jewish students’ union had set up tables near La Sorbonne University to bring together students of all backgrounds to debate. “This is exactly what I wanted: to be able to talk,” said Yossef, a Jewish final-year journalism student who was engaged in a polite but intense exchange with Mohammed, a French-Moroccan economics PhD student. “I find it absolutely amazing to be able to stand here and talk, disagree but still talk it out, without being shocked by what the other person is saying, and – crucially – letting the other person finish,” said Mohammed. “We’re lucky that in France we can have these conversations equal to equal.” Samuel Lejoyeux, the president of the Union of Jewish students and a former student at Sciences Po, said: “If someone mobilises for Palestinian people’s rights, there isn’t a problem with that.” He said the problem was if the movement became radicalised and created antisemitism. “So what we wanted to do by creating this space of dialogue is to be able to speak about the Israel-Palestine conflict without invective and insults. We’re trying to recreate something positive because we know this conflict generates so much tension.”",,2024-05-03 16:25:14+00:00,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/may/03/were-infantilised-or-demonised-french-students-criticise-gaza-protests-crackdown,The Guardian
105,,"Passionate yogis in Italy have been taking their downward dog to the next level in studios offering “puppy yoga” classes. But the health ministry has curtailed the growing trend after banning the use of pups to protect the animals’ health and welfare. The ministry announced that only adult dogs could be used for “animal assisted” wellbeing activities, including yoga. The ministry said it had been made aware of organisations that would “directly contact dog breeders” in order to temporarily use puppies for yoga sessions. Animal rights groups had called for a ban after reports in the Italian media revealed alleged mistreatment of the puppies. Piera Rosati, the president of LNDC Animal Protection, said the puppies were exploited for commercial purposes. “Yoga, at least in theory, should not be just a practice of physical exercise but also a spiritual one, in search of harmony with the universe,” she said. “But this harmony and wellbeing are not granted to puppies who are used as objects to do business.” Giusy D’Angelo, a dog expert with Italy’s national board for animal protection, said people could become so overwhelmed with emotion after being in such proximity to puppies they risked making the impulsive decision to adopt one. “It can lead them to make a decision without really considering the implications,” she said.
Puppy yoga, also known as “doga”, has become increasingly popular around the world, with supporters saying the presence of the animals enhances the feeling of calm that comes with the exercise. The puppies roam free around the studios and are there to provide cuddles rather than perform any yoga moves. “There are many reasons why people do puppy yoga,” said Francesco Di Turi, a manager at Puppy Yoga Official, which organises puppy yoga at gyms and studios across Italy. “Some might simply want contact with an animal because they don’t have one at home, while there are others suffering from illnesses who find that one hour of practice really helps them to relax.” According to the company’s website, all of its classes held before the ban came into force on 29 April were sold out. “This measure doesn’t make sense,” said Di Turi. “Nobody ever came to check what actually happens during a class. “It will impact a lot of people – we have over 80 staff and since 29 April we haven’t worked. Trying to do this with adult dogs is much more complex.” But not all yogis like working with dogs. Amity Neumeister, who owns the Zem yoga studio in Rome, hosted puppies for one session. “It was too chaotic,” she said. “We spent a lot of time chasing after them, cleaning up pee and poo.”",,2024-05-03 15:23:12+00:00,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/may/03/italy-bans-puppy-yoga-reports-alleged-mistreatment,The Guardian
106,,"My husband, Bob Body, who has died aged 73, dedicated his life to researching and documenting the work of the RAF Special Duties squadrons of the second world war, sparked by the story of his uncle Flt Lt John Menzies, a pilot with No 161 (Special Duties) Squadron who was lost on operations into occupied Europe. Bob wrote two books on the subject – Taking the Wings of the Morning (2003), about the search for Menzies; and Runways to Freedom (2016), a history of the squadrons. On inheriting his uncle’s medals in 1985, Bob became determined to find out what had happened to him. He began to research the work of the two highly secret squadrons, based at RAF Tempsford in Bedfordshire, and to glean information that had been unavailable for many years. In 1997 Menzies’s remains were discovered in the IJsselmeer, a lake in the Netherlands, and he was buried with full military honours alongside his crew in the little town of Makkum, in Friesland. This discovery marked the beginning of the most serious phase of Bob’s research work. Born in Egham, Surrey, Bob was the son of Anne (nee Menzies) and John Body, a town planning officer. He went to Strode’s college in the town. He and I married in 1981, settling in Farnborough, Hampshire. Alongside his day job as a technical officer for a manufacturer of building supplies, Bob worked hard in his research of the squadrons. At the outset, some of the records were still unavailable, and those that could be accessed were in hard copy or microfilm/fiche only, necessitating hours of transcription in the National Archives at Kew. Bob built up an enormous library of records. After the discovery of his uncle’s remains in 1997, Bob and I met the families of the crew members, and a group was formed. In 2000, we set up a website as a point of contact between the group, which now has about 400 members. As more relatives came forward with requests for information, Bob would research each individual on their behalf and report back with his findings. In 2006, following the death of his father, Bob took early retirement and we moved to Crete. As well as continuing his work on the squadrons, Bob volunteered with a local animal welfare group, fundraising and helping with neutering campaigns.

107,,"Leprosy passed between humans and red squirrels in medieval England, research suggests, supporting the theory that the fur trade could have played a role in the spread of the disease. Leprosy is one of the oldest infectious diseases recorded in humans and is typically caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium leprae. While most cases now occur in south-east Asia, and can be treated with antibiotics, leprosy was common in medieval England and caused sickness and disfigurement in rich and poor people alike. Previous research revealed that people in medieval England, Denmark and Sweden had a similar strain of leprosy to that found today in red squirrels in the south of England, with one theory being that the trading of squirrel furs, imported from Viking Scandinavia, could have been a factor in spreading the disease. Now experts say the theory has been given a boost, with genetic analysis revealing that red squirrels in medieval England experienced a very similar strain of the disease to humans living at the time. “This is the first time that we found an animal host of leprosy in the archaeological record, which is really exciting,” said Dr Sarah Inskip from the University of Leicester, who co-authored the research.
Writing in the journal Current Biology, Inskip and an international team of colleagues report how they studied strains of leprosy found in samples from three people who lived in Winchester between 900 and 600 years ago, and a squirrel whose bones were found in a furrier pit in the city dating to between 1,000 and 900 years ago. The team focused on Winchester because it was an important city in the medieval period and had a leper hospital and myriad skinners involved in the preparation and selling of fur-lined clothes – meaning it was possible to obtain squirrel and human remains from the time. The team extracted and analysed DNA from the samples, revealing a very similar strain of leprosy was present in all. “In fact, the strains that are in the archaeological squirrels and the archaeological humans from Winchester are more closely related than the strain that’s in the medieval squirrels [and] the strain that is in modern squirrels,” said Inskip. The team say the results suggest there was transmission of the disease between humans and squirrels.
However, the findings are based on just a handful of samples, and the results cannot shed light on whether humans initially caught leprosy from red squirrels or vice versa. Inskip said that even in the latter case, the animals could pass the disease back to humans, noting that while humans first gave the disease to armadillos in the Americas, they can now catch it from the animals. “We know that it can ping-pong backwards and forwards,” she said. Inskip added that there were a number of possibilities for how transmission may have occurred. “One mechanism would be the fur trade,” she said. Indeed the study reports that in 1384 alone, 377,200 squirrel skins were imported to England from Scandinavia and other places. However squirrels were also widely kept as pets, offering another route of contact with humans. “Both mechanisms are possible. And they’re not mutually exclusive either,” said Inskip. Inskip said the study also had implications for people suffering from leprosy today. “Maybe we need to go and look at the animals that are around these communities,” she said. “Because perhaps it’s possible that some of these animals maybe have the bacteria and that’s maybe why the disease is hanging around.”",,2024-05-03 15:00:15+00:00,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/may/03/leprosy-passed-between-medieval-squirrels-and-humans-study-suggests,The Guardian
108,Closing summary,"The Lithuanian government has said there have been “false Russian claims of sabotage planned by a person who allegedly entered to Russia from Lithuania in March”. Vilmantas Vitkauskas, head of the National Crisis Management Centre said Russia claims that a saboteur had any links to Lithuania were false. He said he did not have any information about the incident reported by Interfax but “this element of linking that to a Nato state” was disinformation. Any Western-backed Ukrainian strike against the Crimean bridge or Crimea itself will be met with a powerful revenge strike from Russia, foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said. “I would like to warn Washington and Brussels that any aggressive actions against Crimea are not only doomed to fail, but will also be met with a devastating revenge strike,” said Zakharova. The US secretary of defence, Lloyd Austin, has confirmed Russian security forces have been deployed to the same airbase as American troops in the Nigerien capital, Niamey. It remains unclear when the Russian troops, who have been in Niger for weeks, were deployed to Airbase 101, which is next to Diori Hamani international airport in Niamey. It is also unclear how many troops are on the ground. Ukraine’s president and foreign minister has pressed British foreign secretary David Cameron to accelerate the delivery of promised military aid to Kyiv, as Russia heaps battlefield pressure on depleted Ukrainian forces in the third year of war. “It is important that the weapons included in the UK support package announced last week arrive as soon as possible,” Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on the social platform X, as Cameron visited Kyiv on Thursday. A Russian activist has been sentenced to 15 years in prison for attempting to set fire to a military conscription office in protest against the Russian action in Ukraine, officials said Friday. A military court in Khabarovsk, in Russia’s far east, said Angel Nikolayev was convicted on charges of terrorism for placing two bottles containing a flammable substance in the windows of a district conscription office in the city and setting them ablaze. The US has been preparing since 2022 for the possibility that Russian president Vladimir Putin would stop selling it nuclear power fuel, and a pending ban on Russian imports will help boost domestic capacity to process uranium fuel, the outgoing top nuclear energy official told Reuters. The US senate passed legislation on Tuesday that bans the imports from Russia, the latest move by Washington to disrupt Putin’s ability to pay for the full-scale invasion of Ukraine that began in 2022. The Czech Republic’s institutions have been targeted by a Russian cyber attack since last year, the Czech foreign ministry said on Friday. It said the Russian APT28 group, believed to be connected to Russia’s GRU military intelligence, had exploited a vulnerability in Microsoft’s Outlook programme, Reuters reported. The ministry issued its statement after the German Interior Ministry said on Friday a series of cyber attacks attributable to the GRU targeted Germany’s governing Social Democrats as well as the country’s logistics, defence, aerospace and IT sectors. Russian defence minister Sergei Shoigu said on Friday that Russian troops had captured 547 sq km of territory in Ukraine this year. Shoigu said Ukrainian forces were retreating all along the front line. The Russian defence ministry said on Friday that its air defence forces destroyed six drones that Ukraine launched overnight.

It remains unclear when the Russian troops, who have been in Niger for weeks, were deployed to Airbase 101, which is next to Diori Hamani international airport in Niamey. It is also unclear how many troops are on the ground. “Airbase 101 where our forces [are], is a Nigerien air force base that is co-located with an international airport in the capital city. The Russians are in a separate compound and don’t have access to US forces or access to our equipment,” Austin said at a press conference in Honolulu. A large crowd of people, some of whom hold a placard reading: ‘US army, you leave, you move, you vanish.

111,Lithuania hits out at Russia 'disinformation' over spy claims,"The Lithuanian government has said there have been “false Russian claims of sabotage planned by a person who allegedly entered to Russia from Lithuania in March”. Vilmantas Vitkauskas, head of the National Crisis Management Centre said Russia claims that a saboteur had any links to Lithuania were false. He said he did not have any information about the incident reported by Interfax but “this element of linking that to a Nato state” was disinformation. “Russia has been systematically conducting disinformation campaigns and provocations for a long time in order to raise tensions among societies and allies and to cover its aggressive actions. “This disinformation spread by the FSB is a case in point. One of the objectives of such aggressive activities is to influence Lithuania’s support for Ukraine. Disinformation will not change Lithuania’s efforts to support Ukraine in its fight for freedom. “Given that Lithuania is currently conducting the Thunder Strike military exercise, we may see more disinformation attacks of this nature.

The US senate passed legislation on Tuesday that bans the imports from Russia, the latest move by Washington to disrupt Putin’s ability to pay for the full-scale invasion of Ukraine that began in 2022. The ban, which is expected to be signed by president Joe Biden, starts 90 days after enactment, although it allows the Department of Energy to issue waivers in case of supply concerns. The move has led to fears that Putin could retaliate by freezing exports to the US boosting uranium prices. Russia supplied about 24% of the uranium used by reactors in the US in 2022, and was its top foreign supplier. But Kathryn Huff, the DoE’s assistant secretary for nuclear, who steps down on Friday, told Reuters the US is prepared for any scenario. “The reality is this: over the last few years there has been a very real and present possibility that Russia could stop abruptly sending enriched uranium to the United States.” Countries including Canada, France and Japan will help the US deal with an “allied alternative” to Russian uranium, Huff said.",,2024-05-03 10:37:58+00:00,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/may/03/russia-ukraine-war-live-russian-troops-enter-us-base-in-niger,The Guardian

126,,"Panama’s supreme court has rejected a move to disqualify the candidacy of the leading presidential contender, José Raúl Mulino, two days before the country’s election on Sunday. The ruling early on Friday removes an element of uncertainty from the vote, but the country remains racked by social discontent, against a backdrop of mass protests, economic slowdown, drought in the Panama Canal and the closure of one of the world’s largest copper mines. With 25-30% of voting intention, polls suggest Mulino has a comfortable lead over his two closest rivals, the lawyer Ricardo Lombana and the former president Martín Torrijos, in a fragmented field.
Mulino only stepped in as a candidate in February, replacing Ricardo Martinelli, the supermarket magnate and former president whose candidacy was annulled after local courts ratified his prison sentence for money laundering. In its ruling, the supreme court rejected an argument that Mulino’s candidacy should also be annulled, since he assumed it without going through party primaries. The current president, Laurentino Cortizo, is constitutionally unable to run for a second consecutive term. But he is in any case deeply unpopular, and his government was rocked by two unprecedented protest movements. The first, in 2022, was triggered by the rising cost of living and deficient social services, given Panama’s status as one of the region’s most unequal countries. The second, in 2023, was sparked by the government’s opaque renegotiation of the contract for the Cobre Panamá mine, which was subsequently closed. Both episodes revealed public mistrust of the governing Partido Revolucionario Democrático and a political elite that has been involved in numerous corruption scandals. Corruption, underlined by the Panama Papers investigation, is a top concern for voters, as is the economy, where a slowdown has been compounded by the closure of the mine and social upheaval that has hit investment. The International Monetary Fund expects growth of 2.5% in 2024, down from 7.5% in 2023. The fact that Martinelli – and by extension Mulino – remains popular despite his conviction for money laundering reflects both the political outsider status he has cultivated and the fact that Panama saw formidable economic growth during his presidency from 2009 to 2014. “People have always justified Martinelli by saying, ‘He stole but he got things done,’” said Juan Diego Alvarado, a political analyst. “The economic conditions that carried that growth are no longer there,” added Alvarado. “But the memory is powerful.” Aside from promising to bring the good times back, Mulino has also vowed to close the Darién Gap, the swampy jungle straddling the border with Colombia that is crossed by hundreds of thousands of US-bound migrants each year. Meanwhile other candidates have emphasised their economic management skills and anti-corruption platforms. All the leading candidates are proposing to change Panama’s constitution, which has remained the same since the return to democracy in 1989, and have supported the protests against the mine with varying degrees of enthusiasm. But experts say there is a lack of substantive variety on the ballot paper. “Panama has great political homogeneity: every political party is centre right. For 30 years Panama has been governed by the centre right,” said Claire Nevache, a political analyst. “So it’s really more about characters and leadership styles than it is about public policy and how to fix Panama’s problems.” If Mulino wins, he has promised to find a way to help Martinelli, who avoided a 10-year jail sentence by taking refuge in the Nicaraguan embassy, where he and his dog, Bruno, are campaigning energetically on social media. To what degree Martinelli would be pulling the strings behind a Mulino presidency remains to be seen. “I suspect Mulino doesn’t have much strength within their party. I think Martinelli controls the party,” said Alvarado. “But whoever wins will not have a majority in the assembly. So they’ll have to build alliances in order to govern.”",,2024-05-03 10:30:14+00:00,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/may/03/panama-presidential-election-jose-raul-mulino,The Guardian
127,Closing summary,"It is 5pm in Gaza and in Tel Aviv. We will be closing this blog soon, but you can stay up to date on the Guardian’s Middle East coverage here. Here is a recap of the latest developments: An Israeli incursion in Rafah could result in ‘slaughter’, a UN official said on Friday. “It could be a slaughter of civilians and an incredible blow to the humanitarian operation in the entire strip because it is run primarily out of Rafah,” said Jens Laerke, spokesperson for the UN humanitarian office, at a Geneva press briefing. A World Health Organization (WHO) official said on Friday that the agency had a contingency plan prepared in case of an Israeli incursion into Gaza’s Rafah but said it would not be sufficient to prevent a substantial rise in the death toll. “I want to really say that this contingency plan is a Band-Aid,” said Rik Peeperkorn, WHO representative for the occupied Palestinian territory, at a Geneva press briefing via video link. Turkey’s trade halt with Israel will continue until a permanent ceasefire in Gaza is secured as well as unhindered humanitarian aid flow to the region, Turkish trade minister Omer Bolat said on Friday. Turkey stopped all exports and imports to and from Israel on Thursday, citing the “worsening humanitarian tragedy” in the Palestinian territories. Turkish exporters with firm orders are looking at ways to send their goods to Israel via third countries four export sector sources told Reuters on Thursday. Israel’s foreign minister, Israel Katz, accused Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, of acting like a “dictator” after the trade restrictions were first reported. Katz added that blocking ports for Israeli imports and exports ignores trade deals, adding on social media platform X that Israel would work toward alternatives for trade with Turkey. The UK on Friday imposed sanctions on two “extremist” groups and four individuals in Israel who it blamed for violence in the West Bank. The British Foreign Office named Hilltop Youth and Lehava as two groups which it said were known to have supported, incited and promoted violence against Palestinian communities in the West Bank. The four individuals sanctioned were responsible for human rights abuses against these communities, the statement added. The UK’s foreign secretary David Cameron said extremist settlers were undermining security and stability and threatening the prospects for peace. An Israeli man held hostage in Gaza since the 7 October Hamas attack has been confirmed dead, the government said early Friday. Dror Or, 49, was killed and his body was held in Gaza since 7 October, said the Be’eri kibbutz where he had lived. International criminal court (ICC) prosecutors warned on Friday against “individuals who threaten to retaliate” against the tribunal or its staff, saying such actions might constitute an “offence against its administration of justice”. The ICC did not say if the comment related to its investigation into possible war crimes by Israel or Palestinian groups in Gaza and the West Bank. The availability of food in the Gaza Strip has very slightly improved, though the risk of famine remains, Rik Peeperkorn, the WHO representative in the Palestinian territories told a press briefing in Geneva via video link from Jerusalem. He said that the threat of famine had “absolutely not” gone away due to the slight improvement in the food situation. Ahmed Dahir, the WHO’s Gaza sub-office team lead added that “access to food now has to be sustained”. Since October 2023, more than 100 Palestinian reporters have been killed in Gaza, including at least 22 in the course of their work, said Reporters Without Borders (RSF) which published its annual World Press Freedom Index on Friday, marking World Press Freedom Day 2024. The Maghreb and Middle East regions performed the worst in terms of restrictions on press freedom by government forces, according to the report. At least 34,622 Palestinians have been killed and 77,867 injured in Israel’s military offensive on Gaza since 7 October, the Hamas-run Gaza health ministry said in a statement on Friday. A senior Palestinian doctor died in an Israeli prison after more than four months of detention, two Palestinian prisoner associations said on Thursday, blaming Israel for his death. The associations said in a joint statement that Adnan al-Bursh, head of orthopedics at al-Shifa hospital, Gaza’s largest medical facility, had been detained by Israeli forces while temporarily working at al-Awada hospital in north Gaza. They called his death an “assassination” and said his body remained in Israeli custody. Francesca Albanese, the UN special rapporteur on the occupied Palestinian territories, said in comments on X that she was alarmed by the death of Bursh in Israeli detention. “No Palestinian is safe under Israel’s occupation today. How many more lives will have to be taken before UN member states, especially those demonstrating genuine concern for human rights globally, act to protect the Palestinians?” she said. On Thursday, the Israeli authorities released 64 Palestinians they had detained during their military offensive in Gaza via the Israeli-controlled Kerem Shalom crossing, the Palestinian borders and crossings agency said. One of them was the body of a man who had died in detention, the prisoners’ associations said. Another freed detainee arrived in critical condition and was moved into hospital upon arrival, the crossings agency added. Iran has released the crew of a seized Portuguese-flagged ship linked to Israel, but remains in control of the vessel itself, foreign minister Hossein Amirabdollahian said. “The seized ship, which turned off its radar in Iran’s territorial waters and jeopardized the security of navigation, is under judicial detention,” Amirabdollahian said, according to a foreign ministry post on X late Thursday night. He said the release of the crew was a humanitarian act and they could return to their countries along with the ship’s captain Police in Paris entered France’s prestigious Sciences Po university on Friday and removed student activists who had occupied its buildings in protest against Israel’s conduct in its war against Hamas in Gaza. A Reuters witness saw police go into the buildings and take out many of the 70-odd protesters inside. Seven people were killed in an overnight airstrike on a home in northern Rafah, according to Al Jazeera’s Tareq Abu Azzoum who was reporting from the southern Gaza district. He said that four of the victims were children. Elsewhere in Rafah, especially to the east, there had been a “surge in airstrikes and artillery bombardment,” Abu Azzoum told Al Jazeera. The Australian government faces a decision next week on whether to support admitting Palestine as a full member of the UN and is swapping notes with allies including South Korea and Germany. A copy of the draft resolution, seen by Guardian Australia, expresses “deep regret and concern” that the US used its veto power to block the proposal at the UN security council last month. Hundreds of pro-Palestinian protesters on Friday met a counterprotest supporting Israel at the University of Sydney. The Australian Broadcasting Corp (ABC) reported a scuffle between the groups. Supporters of both sides later backed down because of a heavy security presence, while the University of Sydney vice-chancellor Mark Scott said there was space for both groups of protesters.",,2024-05-03 12:47:31+00:00,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/may/03/middle-east-crisis-israel-hostages-gaza-hamas-war-ceasefire-talks,The Guardian
128,World Press Freedom Index,"Annie Kelly is a human rights journalist for the Guardian and Observer. Political attacks on press freedom, including the detention of journalists, suppression of independent media outlets and widespread dissemination of misinformation, have significantly intensified in the past year, according to the annual World Press Freedom Index published by Reporters Without Borders (RSF). The index ranks 180 countries on the ability of journalists to work and report freely and independently. The Maghreb and Middle East regions performed the worst in terms of restrictions on press freedom by government forces, according to the report. In the past year, said RSF, governments across the region have attempted to control and curtail the media through violence, arrests and draconian laws, compounded by “systematic impunity for crimes of violence against journalists”.
The RSF says that, since October 2023, more than 100 Palestinian reporters have been killed in Gaza, including at least 22 in the course of their work. Elsewhere in the region, journalists have been killed in Sudan, where there have been serious attempts to curb independent reporting of violence and civil war.

130,The UK  sanctions Israeli groups and individuals for violence in West Bank,"The UK on Friday imposed sanctions on two “extremist” groups and four individuals in Israel who it blamed for violence in the West Bank, its latest package of measures against Israeli settlers, reports Reuters. The British Foreign Office named Hilltop Youth and Lehava as two groups which it said were known to have supported, incited and promoted violence against Palestinian communities in the West Bank. The four individuals sanctioned were responsible for human rights abuses against these communities, the statement added. Among them are Noam Federman, who has trained settler groups in committing violence and Elisha Yered, who has justified killing Palestinians on religious grounds, reports Reuters. Violence in the West Bank was already on the rise before Israel’s assault on Gaza, but it has escalated since, with stepped-up Israeli military raids, settler violence and Palestinian street attacks.
The UK’s foreign secretary David Cameron said extremist settlers were undermining security and stability and threatening the prospects for peace. “The Israeli authorities must clamp down on those responsible. The UK will not hesitate to take further action if needed, including through further sanctions,” he said. Those sanctioned will be subject to financial and travel restrictions. The UK previously imposed sanctions on four Israeli nationals in February.",,2024-05-03 12:39:09+00:00,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/may/03/middle-east-crisis-israel-hostages-gaza-hamas-war-ceasefire-talks,The Guardian
131,Gaza Strip,"The availability of food in the Gaza Strip has very slightly improved, though the risk of famine remains, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Friday, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP). “The food situation has a little bit improved. There’s a bit more food,” Rik Peeperkorn, the WHO representative in the Palestinian territories, told a press briefing in Geneva via video link from Jerusalem. Compared to a few months ago, “definitely there is more basic food, more wheat, but also a little bit more diversified food on the market. Not just in the south – also in the north”, where people have been surviving on the equivalent calories of less than a can of beans a day. Ahmed Dahir, the WHO’s Gaza sub-office team lead, said that previously, “thousands” of people had been rushing at WHO trucks heading to northern Gaza – which has been most at risk of famine – in the hope of finding food.
“It has changed in the last few weeks. Now there is more food coming, and going to the north,” he said, speaking from the Gaza Strip. According to AFP, Dahir said the food situation remained “fragile” in Gaza, while the population also lacked the cash to pay for food in the markets. “Access to food now has to be sustained,” he said. Peeperkorn stressed that local food production, such as fruit, vegetables and fish in the Gaza Strip had been “destroyed” by the war. The threat of famine had “absolutely not” gone away due to the slight improvement in the food situation, Peeperkorn said. “We cannot say the risk has passed,” Dahir added. Israel has often accused the United Nations and non-governmental organisations of not distributing aid quickly enough, but those have blamed the restrictions and inspections imposed by Israel. Peeperkorn hit out at snags holding up WHO missions around the Gaza Strip. “Sometimes, what we could do in one mission, we have to do in four. It’s incredibly labour intensive and also incredibly costly,” he said.",,2024-05-03 12:22:23+00:00,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/may/03/middle-east-crisis-israel-hostages-gaza-hamas-war-ceasefire-talks,The Guardian
132,International criminal court prosecutors warn against 'individuals who threaten to retaliate' against tribunal or its staff,"International criminal court prosecutors warned on Friday against “individuals who threaten to retaliate” against the tribunal or its staff, saying such actions might constitute an “offence against its administration of justice”. The ICC did not say if the comment related to its investigation into possible war crimes by Israel or Palestinian groups in Gaza and the West Bank. US media said this week the ICC might issue an arrest warrant for Israeli officials including prime minister Benyamin Netanyahu and that the latter had urged US president Joe Biden to prevent the court from doing so. On Friday, The Hague-based office of ICC chief prosecutor Karim Khan said on X that it sought to “engage constructively with all stakeholders whenever dialogue is consistent with its mandate”. “That independence and impartiality are undermined, however, when individuals threaten to retaliate against the court or against court personnel” if it “made decisions” about probes that fell in its mandate, it said. “Such threats, even not acted upon, may constitute an offence” against the ICC’s “administration of justice”, it said. “The Office insists that all attempts to impede, intimidate or improperly influence its officials cease immediately.” Khan’s office declined to answer questions from AFP as to where the threats of retaliation may have originated from. It also declined to comment when asked whether it was referring to its investigation into Israel and the war in Gaza. The ICC opened a probe in 2021 into Israel, as well as Hamas and other armed Palestinian groups, over possible war crimes in the occupied Palestinian territories. Khan has said this investigation now “extends to the escalation of hostilities and violence since the (Hamas) attacks that took place on 7 October 2023”.",,2024-05-03 11:55:14+00:00,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/may/03/middle-east-crisis-israel-hostages-gaza-hamas-war-ceasefire-talks,The Guardian

Unlike in some college campuses across the US, the French protests have been peaceful and there were no signs of violence as the students were brought out of the buildings, reported Reuters.

137,"Rafah operation could result in 'slaughter', UN official says","An Israeli incursion in Rafah would put the lives of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians at risk and be a huge blow to the humanitarian operations of the Gaza Strip, the UN humanitarian office said on Friday, according to Reuters. “It could be a slaughter of civilians and an incredible blow to the humanitarian operation in the entire strip because it is run primarily out of Rafah,” said Jens Laerke, spokesperson for the UN humanitarian office, at a Geneva press briefing. Aid operations run from Rafah included medical clinics and food distribution points, including centres for malnourished children, he said.
A World Health Organization (WHO) official said at the same briefing that a contingency plan for an incursion had been prepared, which included a new field hospital, but said it would not be enough to prevent a substantial rise in the death toll (See 10.32 BST). “I want to really say that this contingency plan is a Band-Aid,” said Rik Peeperkorn, WHO representative for the occupied Palestinian territory via video link. “It will absolutely not prevent the expected substantial additional mortality and morbidity posed by a military operation.” He added that he was “extremely concerned” that any incursion would close the Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt which is being used to import medical supplies.",,2024-05-03 10:30:49+00:00,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/may/03/middle-east-crisis-israel-hostages-gaza-hamas-war-ceasefire-talks,The Guardian

Israel’s foreign minister Israel Katz said blocking ports for Israeli imports and exports ignores trade deals, adding on social media platform X that Israel would work toward alternatives for trade with Turkey. According to Reuters, Turkey has denounced Israel’s military campaign in Gaza, sent thousands of tons of aid for Palestinians and, this week, said it would join South Africa’s genocide case against Israel at the International Court of Justice (ICJ). Yet its decision to maintain commercial ties with Israel until last month, despite Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s strong rhetoric, prompted a domestic backlash and hurt the results of the ruling AK Party in nationwide local elections in March, writes the news agency. Hamas said on Friday Turkey’s trade halt was “brave and reflective of the Turkish people’s longstanding support for Palestinian rights and self-determination.” Turkey maintains ties with Hamas leaders and does not deem it a terrorist group.",,2024-05-03 10:00:57+00:00,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/may/03/middle-east-crisis-israel-hostages-gaza-hamas-war-ceasefire-talks,The Guardian

141,Israeli,"Earlier on Thursday, the Israeli authorities released 64 Palestinians they had detained during their military offensive in Gaza via the Israeli-controlled Kerem Shalom crossing, the Palestinian borders and crossings agency said, according to Reuters. One of them was the body of another man who had died in detention, the prisoners’ associations said. Another freed detainee arrived in critical condition and was moved into hospital upon arrival, the crossings agency added. Dozens of Palestinians who had been freed by Israel in past months including some staff of a UN agency have reported ill-treatment during detention, including torture and deprivation of food and sleep. The two new deaths bring the toll of Palestinians who died in Israeli custody to at least 18 since the start of the war, the prisoners associations said, urging Israeli authorities to disclose the number, location and fate of detainees from Gaza. The UN Palestinian Refugee Agency has documented the release of 1,506 people detained by the Israeli authorities through the Kerem Shalom crossing as of 4 April and said the transfer of detainees regularly holds up aid.

142,Palestinian,"A senior Palestinian doctor died in an Israeli prison after more than four months of detention, two Palestinian prisoner associations said on Thursday, blaming Israel for his death. According to Reuters, the associations said in a joint statement that Adnan al-Bursh, head of orthopedics at al-Shifa hospital, Gaza’s largest medical facility, had been detained by Israeli forces while temporarily working at al-Awada hospital in north Gaza. They called his death an “assassination” and said his body remained in Israeli custody. Reuters reports that the Israeli prison service issued a statement on 19 April, saying that a prisoner detained for national security reasons had died in Ofer prison but giving no detail on the cause of death. A prison service spokesperson confirmed to Reuters that the statement referred to Bursch, and said the incident was being investigated. Medical groups, including the World Health Organization, have repeatedly called for a halt to attacks on Gaza healthcare workers, with more than 200 killed so far in the Gaza conflict, according to an estimate from Insecurity Insight, a research group that collects and analyses data on attacks on aid workers around the world. The Palestinian health ministry said in a statement that Bursh’s death raised to 496 the number of medical sector workers who had been killed by Israel since 7 October. It added that 1,500 others had been injured while 309 had been arrested.

The Australian government faces a decision next week on whether to support admitting Palestine as a full member of the UN and is swapping notes with allies including South Korea and Germany.

The Palestinian-backed draft text, due for a vote in New York on 10 May, will be put to the general assembly where all UN member states have a vote. It laments that “one negative vote” had scuttled a proposal backed by 12 others in the 15-member security council, including US allies South Korea, Japan and France. The UK and Switzerland abstained. The proposed new resolution is understood to be backed by the Arab Group and some members of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation.

146,Pro-Palestinian protesters,"Pro-Palestinian protesters were camped on university campuses across Australia on Friday, with some scuffling with pro-Israel protesters in Sydney, mirroring similar events in the US, reports the Associated Press (AP). Students have set up encampments at universities in major Australian cities over the last two weeks to protest Israel’s offensive in Gaza. According to the AP, the students are demanding that universities sever all academic ties with Israel and cut off research partnerships with arms manufacturers. The news agency reports that no arrests were made, as the violence seen on some US campuses has not occurred in Australia. Hundreds of pro-Palestinian protesters on Friday met a counterprotest supporting Israel at the University of Sydney, Australia’s oldest university. The Australian Broadcasting Corp (ABC) reported a scuffle between the groups. Supporters of both sides later backed down because of a heavy security presence.
University of Sydney vice-chancellor Mark Scott said there was space for both groups of protesters. “They may strongly disagree with the matters that have been discussed … We can host that conversation and we should be able to do that in a non-threatening way,” he told ABC.

Two years ago, Spain’s socialist-led government introduced a Democratic Memory law designed to bring “justice, reparation and dignity” to the victims of the civil war and subsequent dictatorship. The law, which built on previous socialist legislation, contains dozens of measures intended to help “settle Spanish democracy’s debt to its past”. Among them were: the creation of a census and a national DNA bank to help locate and identify the remains of the tens of thousands of people who still lie in unmarked graves; a ban on groups that glorify the Franco regime; and a “redefinition” of the Valley of the Fallen, the giant basilica and memorial where Franco lay for 44 years until his exhumation in 2019.

We call on the Georgian leadership to withdraw the draft law and concentrate their efforts on reforms necessary for the accession to the EU and NATO,” they added.",,2024-05-03 09:04:22+00:00,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/may/03/europe-live-georgian-pm-steps-up-anti-western-rhetoric-following-protests,The Guardian

162,Georgia's prime minister doubles down on anti-western rhetoric,"As western governments condemn a police crackdown on protesters in Georgia, the country’s prime minister, Irakli Kobakhidze, has repeated conspiratorial narratives and lashed out at the United States – while attempting to draw a parallel between police action in Georgia and police action on US college campuses. Georgia’s government has been pushing a ‘foreign agents’ law which critics say is anti-democratic and inspired by Russia. Protesters have been taking to the streets to urge the bill to be withdrawn and call for Georgia to stay on the path toward western integration. The US and European governments, meanwhile, have warned Georgia’s leadership that the bill – and police violence against protesters – are jeopardising the country’s future prospects. In a post on social media this morning, the Georgian prime minister said he spoke with Derek Chollet, the Counselor of the US state department and “expressed my sincere disappointment with the two revolution attempts of 2020-2023 supported by the former US Ambassador and those carried out through NGOs financed from external sources”. The bill would require groups such as NGOs receiving more than 20% of their funding from outside Georgia to register as foreign agents. He accused American diplomats of making “false statements” and “clarified to Mr Chollet that it requires a special effort to restart the relations against this background, which is impossible without a fair and honest approach”. “I have not expressed my concerns with Mr Chollet about a brutal crackdown of the students’ protest rally in New York City,” Kobakhidze added.",,2024-05-03 09:04:22+00:00,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/may/03/europe-live-georgian-pm-steps-up-anti-western-rhetoric-following-protests,The Guardian

164,,"The US secretary of defence, Lloyd Austin, has confirmed Russian security forces have been deployed to the same airbase as American troops in the Nigerien capital, Niamey. It remains unclear when the Russian troops, who have been in Niger for weeks, were deployed to Airbase 101, which is next to Diori Hamani international airport in Niamey. It is also unclear how many troops are on the ground. “Airbase 101 where our forces [are], is a Nigerien air force base that is co-located with an international airport in the capital city. The Russians are in a separate compound and don’t have access to US forces or access to our equipment,” Austin said at a press conference in Honolulu. In response to news of the deployment, the Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, told reporters in Moscow on Friday that Russia was “developing ties with various African countries in all areas, including in the military one”. The development is the latest fallout from a coup in July last year that deposed the democratically elected president, Mohamed Bazoum. Niger’s junta has since embarked on a reconfiguration of its partnerships with western allies. Troops from the US and France, which has a strained relationship with many countries in the region, most of them being its former colonies, have been asked to leave their bases. Russia is continuing to make inroads into parts of the continent, reawakening cold war-era relations in recent years and in some cases presenting “regime stabilisation” packages to African leaders. The face of Moscow’s presence has mostly been the Wagner mercenary group. Ikemesit Effiong, the head of research at Lagos-based geopolitical risk advisory SBM Intelligence, said the presence of Russian and US troops in the same Nigerien base is evidence that the region is now “a live geopolitical faultline, with a pro-western coastal West Africa and a Russophile Sahel”. “With the fraying of democracy and stressed economies within the region, countries will fall in and out of both blocs with a frequency that will keep Washington and Moscow busy for years to come,” he added. After the coup, the US military moved some of its forces in Niger from Airbase 101 to Airbase 201 in the city of Agadez. It is not clear what US military equipment remains at Airbase 101. The US built Airbase 201 in central Niger at a cost of more than £80m. Since 2018, it has been used to target Islamic State and the al-Qaida affiliate Jama’at Nusrat al-Islam wal Muslimeen with drones. Washington is concerned about jihadists in the Sahel region possibly expanding their sphere of influence without western-led counterinsurgency activity, especially in intelligence. Niger’s move to ask for the removal of US troops came after a meeting in Niamey in mid-March, when senior US officials raised concerns including about the expected arrival of Russian forces and reports of Iran seeking raw materials in the country, including uranium.",,2024-05-03 13:00:04+00:00,World news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/may/03/us-confirms-russian-forces-have-entered-airbase-in-niger-where-us-troops-are-stationed,The Guardian
165,,"China has launched a probe to collect samples from the far side of the moon - in a world first - as part of its goal to land a human on the lunar surface by 2030. A rocket carrying the Chang’e-6 lunar probe blasted off from the Wenchang Space Launch Center in southern China’s Hainan province just before 5.30 pm (0930 GMT). The mission has drawn concern from China’s major rival, the US, over Beijing’s geopolitical intentions amid what the head of Nasa has called a new “space race”.
Since the first Chang’e mission in 2007, named after the mythical Chinese moon goddess, China has made leaps forward in its lunar exploration, narrowing the technological chasm with the United States and Russia. With no direct line of sight with the Earth, Chang’e-6 must rely on a recently deployed relay satellite orbiting the moon during its 53-day mission, including a never-before attempted ascent from the moon’s “hidden” side on its return journey home. The same relay satellite will support two more uncrewed missions in 2026 and 2028, aimed at exploring the south pole for water and building a rudimentary outpost with Russia, in an effort to achieve Beijing’s aim of putting astronauts on the moon by 2030.
As part of its mission, the Chang’e-6 will attempt to retrieve samples from the south pole Aitken Basin, the largest and oldest impact crater on the moon, situated on the side permanently facing away from Earth. Experts say the samples which could answer questions about a significant period of solar system activity billions of years ago. State news agency Xinhua hailed the launch as “the first endeavour of its kind in the history of human lunar exploration”. Neil Melville-Kenney, a technical officer at the European Space Agency working with Chinese researchers on one of the Chang’e-6 payloads, told Reuters: “The far side of the moon has a mystique perhaps because we literally can’t see it, we have never seen it apart from with robotic probes or the very few number of humans that have been around the other side.” Should the mission be successful, the Chinese National Space Administration (CNSA) is expected to share the samples internationally, just as it did with the moon rocks collected during the 5th Chang’e mission – the first collected since the US Apollo missions. That mission in 2020 confirmed for the first time that China could safely return an uncrewed spacecraft to Earth from the lunar surface. China’s space program is central to the government’s overall national strategy, and is widely celebrated within the country as a demonstration of the nation’s technological advancement. Beijing’s polar plans have worried Nasa, whose administrator, Bill Nelson, has repeatedly warned that China would claim any water resources as its own. Beijing says it remains committed to cooperation with all nations on building a “shared” future. Nelson has also warned of China bolstering its space capabilities by using civilian programs to mask military objectives, cautioning that Washington must remain vigilant. The US is planning to put astronauts back on the moon by 2026 with its Artemis 3 mission.

226,,"Mikel Arteta had wanted something less stressful than Arsenal’s previous home win over Bournemouth and he got his wish. In March of last year, his team had needed a 97th-minute Reiss Nelson goal to complete a wild 3-2 victory from 2-0 down. Here there was glory in the general sense of comfort and control, Arsenal moving to 83 points, still asking the question of the defending champions, Manchester City, who kick-off against Wolves at 5.30pm.
It was not entirely straightforward; it rarely is. Arsenal caught a break at 2-0 up when an Antoine Semenyo goal was disallowed on the advice of the VAR for a foul by Dominic Solanke on the goalkeeper, David Raya. Solanke looked to have done rather less than, say, Ben White does to opposing goalkeepers on corners; the centre-forward stood his ground, Raya’s weak punch being volleyed back against the crossbar by Ryan Christie before Semenyo put it in. Bournemouth were flabbergasted. A goal then might have made it interesting. As it was, Arsenal eased home and deservedly so. A debatable Bukayo Saka penalty had been scant reward for their first-half dominance and, if in-form Bournemouth were more threatening after the interval, they were second best overall. Arsenal did score again in the 97th minute but this time it was merely the gloss from Declan Rice on both an excellent individual performance and the scoreline. Leandro Trossard had got Arsenal’s second and they intend to finish with two more wins – against Manchester United and Everton – to take them to 89 points; one shy of the tally of the Invincibles from 2003-04. Will it be enough to match their title-winning achievement? Arteta’s plan was to watch the City game afterwards and it was fun to imagine him pulling on a Wolves shirt, sipping on a pint of Banks’s, singing for the Old Gold. He had said on Friday that in his “heart and soul” he was hoping for a City slip. His focus of the day, though, was only here, on doing what he and Arsenal needed to do. Bournemouth presented a challenge, particularly with Semenyo having made a Lazarus-like recovery from the injury he suffered against Brighton last Sunday. Carried off on a stretcher, Andoni Iraola said then that it looked bad. Semenyo was able to take his place on the right wing of the manager’s 4-3-3 formation.
It is not just the Liverpool manager, Jürgen Klopp, who does not like 12.30 pm kick-offs. They are just too early. Yet Arsenal roared out of the blocks, doing everything right at the outset. They were physical, squeezing high, giving Bournemouth no time on the ball. And they were slick when they had it, their movements so sharp. The Bournemouth goalkeeper, Mark Travers, was put on notice that he was in for a busy game. Bournemouth’s defenders threw themselves in front of shots; four times inside the opening ten minutes and plenty more after that. The first half-hour was akin to a siege; Travers prominent. His best save during that period was to keep out a Takehiro Tomiyasu header at the far post following a corner. There were others, the block from William Saliba and the plunge to his right to push away a Thomas Partey curler worthy of mention. Arsenal could also point to a wayward Partey shot when he had been well placed Bournemouth barely crossed halfway in the first-half, although Arsenal did need Saliba to make a important tackle on Solanke in the 18th minute after an error by Gabriel Magalhães. Arsenal’s patience and composure was tested, especially after Rice lashed wide on 38 minutes after a headed set-up by Havertz. Rice had waited too long, allowing the ball to bounce twice. Was it going to be one of those days? Arsenal did not believe that, not with Martin Ødegaard pulling the strings like a master puppeteer, not with Saka shrugging off knocks – including a studs-up tackle from Ryan Christie in the 11th minute that was somehow deemed to be unworthy of a card – to go again and again. The penalty was soft. Kai Havertz simply bought it, having run onto an Ødegaard pass and seen Travers commit himself. Havertz waited for the contact, leaving his trailing leg in to feel it and, when it was there, over he went. Travers had played with fire with the challenge. Saka’s conversion from the spot was prefaced by a stutter.
Havertz’s first touch was so easy on the eye; ditto his gamboling style. He shimmered with menace, teeing up Saka at the start of the second-half; the winger shot weakly at Travers when he had to score. Arsenal needed a second goal because Bournemouth dug out a foothold in the second-half, Solanke working Raya from a tight angle after Ødegaard had been robbed. Bournemouth sensed opportunity in the transitions. The home crowd worried that the lead was precarious and they bellowed their encouragement. Trossard would calm them down. His finish was in the no-nonsense category, steered home after Ødegaard’s pass had deflected and Rice sculpted the deftest of touches for the assist. When Bournemouth were denied by the VAR, Arsenal looked home and hosed. Ødegaard went close to scoring for 3-0 while Gabriel saw a screamer ruled out for offside against Havertz in the middle following an Ødegaard cross. The last word would go to Rice.",,2024-05-04 13:53:25+00:00,Football,https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/may/04/arsenal-bournemouth-premier-league-match-report,The Guardian
227,,"On this evidence the best thing Daniel Farke could probably do is book his Leeds squad seats on a plane heading somewhere hot and let them lounge by a swimming pool until the first leg of their playoff semi-final at Norwich next Sunday. Five or six days of vitamin D looks the only hope for a side mentally and physically shattered by a season when they have collected 90 points but still miss out on automatic promotion. There was the faintest hope of it at kick off but, as soon as Ipswich scored at home to Huddersfield, the motorway to the Premier League was effectively closed. It leaves Leeds third and facing a hazardous diversion taking in East Anglia and, should they make it that far, north-west London.
Leeds could yet end up facing Southampton again in the Wembley final but if this was a dress rehearsal for such a showpiece the psychological advantage will rest with the smart counterattacking visitors. Southampton arrived here on the back of three straight defeats but even though this ultimately turned into a bit of a phoney war they still showed sufficient quality to demonstrate why their own acquisition of 87 points was no fluke. West Brom will not be relishing their impending semi-final. Thick cloud banked low in the skies before kick off and the home fans’ mood swiftly turned as grey as the weather. When Leeds failed, repeatedly, to clear Southampton’s first corner, Che Adams was allowed to cross in the direction of Adam Armstrong and the striker’s immaculately executed half-volley proved far too good for Illan Meslier.
Although Joel Piroe’s equalised thanks to a crisp right-foot shot after Southampton failed to cope with Wilfried’s Gnonto’s cross, the visitors swiftly answered back. Thanks to an amalgam of startling pace and extremely nifty footwork, the gifted right-back Kyle Walker-Peters performed wonders to keep the ball in play before crossing for the on-rushing, and slackly marked Will Smallbone to restore his team’s advantage courtesy of a first-time shot taken in the midfielder’s advancing stride. Taylor Harwood-Bellis spent much of the game sharing duelling duties with Walker-Peters as they endeavoured to subdue Crysencio Summerville but Harwood-Bellis took time out from helping shadow the Championship’s player of the season to rattle the bar with a header. It highlighted the generosity of a home defence that seemed to spring leaks virtually every time Southampton counterattacked. Admittedly, the news that Ipswich were two up against Huddersfield hardly served as an incentive but it was all too easy to see why a Leeds side desperately missing the injured Patrick Bamford have ended the season a run of one win in six games. They look all played out and Farke has to find a way of persuading Summerville and co to prove that while form may be temporary, class is permanent.",,2024-05-04 13:49:07+00:00,Football,https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/may/04/leeds-southampton-championship-match-report,The Guardian
228,,"Birmingham City’s chairman, Tom Wagner, insists relegation to League One will not derail his grand plans for the club but it is impossible not to acknowledge it is a significant backwards step. Birmingham’s American owners plan to build a 60,000-capacity arena on a 48-acre site in nearby Bordesley Green, a world-class facility if it materialises, but no amount of CGI images can sugarcoat a thoroughly deflating end to another depressing season. As arch-rivals Aston Villa close in on qualifying for the Champions League, Birmingham drop into the third tier for the first time since 1994-95. Birmingham’s 13-season run in the Championship is over. “Que sera sera, whatever will be will be, you’re going to Shrewsbury,” sang the visiting Norwich supporters.
Birmingham’s survival always hinged on getting favours elsewhere and, with results going against them, ultimately a narrow victory courtesy of Paik Seung-ho’s second-half header was insufficient. There was no pinwheeling Paul Caddis moment to get them out of jail this time. Perhaps the only consolation is whereas a decade ago there were fears of administration, if not liquidation, financially at least they appear in rude health. For Norwich, attention will turn to facing Leeds in the playoffs next weekend with a place in the Premier League up for grabs. Birmingham had been circling the drain for a while – they had not finished above 17th since 2015-16, during Gary Rowett’s first spell in charge – and this time there was no salvation story. Rowett namechecked Caddis in the buildup to the game, referencing his heroic 93rd-minute equaliser at Bolton 10 years ago to stave off relegation on the final day and acknowledged the opportunity for another player to make themselves a hero. But Paik’s winner proved inadequate, given those above them, Plymouth, Sheffield Wednesday and Blackburn, all ran out victorious. Birmingham had survived in the last knockings of two seasons since Caddis’s header for Lee Clark’s side and so few could argue this had not been coming. The galling thing for Birmingham supporters is that it is impossible to ignore the sense the club brought much of this predicament on themselves. Birmingham’s board sacked John Eustace in October when the club were sixth in the table and wooed Wayne Rooney to replace him, heralding the appointment as a “defining moment” on their journey. It proved one for the wrong reasons, that hasty decision backfiring as Rooney lost nine of his 15 matches and lasted 83 days in the job before Tony Mowbray was tasked with securing their second-tier status. When Mowbray stepped back in February for medical reasons, Rowett returned to take over the baton until the end of the season. Wagner, in a loud blue blazer, applauded the Birmingham players as they emerged for the warmup and long before the toe-tapping Mr Blue Sky echoed around St Andrew’s 10 minutes before kick-off, the home supporters were in the mood for another great escape. Kojo Miyoshi saw an early effort repelled by Angus Gunn in the Norwich goal but Paik squandered the first clear opening, fluffing his lines after meeting Jay Stansfield’s cutback close to the penalty spot. Krystian Bielik saw Miyoshi’s cross bounce off his midriff and wide via Gunn after Shane Duffy registered a swing and a miss when attempting to clear. Birmingham’s supporters in the Gil Merrick Stand endeavoured to rouse their players as they headed down the tunnel at the interval. Birmingham got the goal they needed to give themselves a chance 10 minutes into the second half, Paik heading in on the edge of the six-yard box after Keshi Anderson’s shot pinballed into his path off the Norwich centre-back Ben Gibson. Supporters gnawed at their fingernails while simultaneously scouring the scores elsewhere. Norwich, meanwhile, seemed to be preparing a playoff date with former manager Daniel Farke, now in charge of Leeds. “We’ll fight to the end,” sang the home support. This time, however, blood and guts were not enough.",,2024-05-04 13:38:44+00:00,Football,https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/may/04/birmingham-norwich-championship-match-report,The Guardian
229,,"Someone has brought an actual tractor. Someone has brought a flag the height of a small house. Someone has brought about two dozen smoke bombs and is letting them off one by one, like rounds of gunfire. Someone is holding a giant drum and someone else is beating it with all his might. A wheelchair emerges out of the blue fog, crushing the broken glass and discarded canisters and empty Madrí cans under its wheels. It’s 11am, and already the centre of Ipswich feels like a battlefield being looted and pillaged. There are thousands gathered here, descended from the Suffolk villages and the Essex commuter towns and the London suburbs, some with tickets and some without: all here on the promise of joy, starved of it, trying to grasp and gulp and plunder as much of it as they can.
How can you not adore football on days like this? How can you walk these streets and not feel the passing of time, the 22 years of watching and waiting, a volcano of ennui and frustration finally bubbling over into something strange and beautiful? The police officers are covered in a fine blue soot. The queue for souvenir programmes stretches a quarter of a mile. Someone starts up a song and everyone joins in: “Robson conquered Europe and won the FA Cup, we all follow Ipswich, when they’re down and when they’re up.” Someone chides Ed Sheeran – celebrity fan and club sponsor – for choosing the Miami Grand Prix over this. And of course there is a kind of mental displacement to all this, a way of not thinking about the 90 agonising minutes to follow. I text an Ipswich-supporting mate: “How you feeling?” The reply comes within seconds. “Horrendous.” I hadn’t been to Portman Road in years. I used to cover Ipswich quite a lot when I was first starting out as a reporter, hours spent on Greater Anglia trains and rail replacement buses for the privilege of being bawled at by Roy Keane every other weekend. What struck me most, even back then, was the absence of hope. The sense of faded prestige. The sober realisation that this was a place with more past than future.
Then, in the final days of 2021, along came a young coach called Kieran McKenna with fresh ideas, fresh energy, fresh hope. Not jaded or grizzled, not trying to save a career, but trying to make a career. Less interested in signing better players than in making better players; five of Saturday’s starting XI arrived before him. A coach who preaches boldness, but who also urges patience, perseverance, trust in the process. And as Ipswich run up against Huddersfield’s deep block, these are again the qualities they require. Nine shots come and go. Conor Chaplin misses a header from six yards. Wes Burns goes clean through on goal, and misses. Leeds go 1-0 down to Southampton. Leeds equalise. None of this is helping. But Massimo Luongo and Sam Morsy are running the midfield, relegated Huddersfield are offering nothing, and on 28 minutes patience is finally rewarded. George Hirst bursts towards the edge of the box, works it to Chaplin, who works it to Burns, who scores. And in that moment the sun is out and the flags are billowing and the vibes are immaculate and everyone just knows. Early in the second half Omari Hutchinson advances, is brought down, somehow stays on his feet. Chris Maxwell gets hands to his shot, and somehow it still goes in. And really this is a pretty good metaphor for Ipswich this season, a team with an inexorability and an inevitability to them, a team who when confronted with walls and barriers have simply walked through them. What a monumental achievement to get promoted not just from the Championship but from this Championship, with the might of Leicester and Leeds and Southampton casting their shadow, with Middlesbrough and West Brom looking strong, with Norwich and Watford still fat on parachute payments. With what is still essentially a souped-up third-tier squad, and only a handful of players with any top-flight experience. The whistle blows and the fans stream onto the turf like a wave, like the same wave that washed this small-town club from the League One relegation zone to the tropical shores of the Premier League. And of course that wave must one day break: perhaps the first time they get stung by VAR, or the first time they get gutted by some supergiant with a billion pounds of talent on the pitch. But through it all, you hope that Ipswich keep the ambition that got them here. You hope they keep this squad together. You hope they keep McKenna. You hope, above all, that they keep remembering to hope.",,2024-05-04 13:37:25+00:00,Football,https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/may/04/ipswich-huddersfield-championship-premier-league-match-report,The Guardian
230,,"Fran Kirby has announced she will call time on her career at Chelsea at the end of the season. The 30-year-old England midfielder has helped the club to six WSL titles, five FA Cups and two League Cups since signing from Reading in 2015. She leaves the club as the all-time leading goalscorer with 115 goals in 205 appearances. In an emotional interview on the club’s website, she said: “To leave with the trophies that I have won, with the teammates I’ve played with – some of the world’s best players – it has been one of the biggest privileges of my life. “Winning trophies has been amazing, but playing with the people I’ve met has been pretty incredible. For a young girl from Reading, it’s not too bad.”
Kirby joined after standout performances for England in their third-place finish at the 2015 Women’s World Cup. In the 2017‑18 season, she won the inaugural Women’s Footballer of the Year award from the Football Writers’ Association after scoring 25 goals in 31 matches in all competitions. She also picked up the PFA Footballer of the Year award and was included in the PFA WSL Team of the year, two feats she repeated in the 2020-21 season. The midfielder, with 19 goals in 70 international appearances, started every match as England secured their first international trophy, the European Championship, in 2022. Last season’s campaign was halted by a knee injury that also ended her hopes of appearing in the 2023 World Cup, and Kirby saluted the support she received during that time. “When I had my illness, my injuries, that’s when I’ve made some friends for life. I will never forget that no matter how bad I felt during those moments, I always felt loved and supported.” Chelsea’s general manager, Paul Green, said: “Fran has been a hugely important player for us over the last nine years. She has played an integral role in the club’s success, winning 15 trophies and earning numerous individual accolades. “She is the club’s leading goalscorer in the modern era and leaves Chelsea with legendary status. We sincerely thank Fran for her contributions and wish her well for the future.” The player has announced her imminent departure in a week when her coach, Emma Hayes, who leaves to join the USA national team this summer, conceded that “the title is done” after Wednesday’s thrilling 4-3 defeat at Liverpool.",,2024-05-04 09:43:08+00:00,Football,https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/may/04/fran-kirby-leave-chelsea-end-of-season,The Guardian

251,", ","Shea Connors was celebrating before the ball had even hit the back of the net, wheeling away as she scored what would prove the winning goal in the 69th minute of Sydney’s 1-0 triumph over Melbourne City in Saturday evening’s A-League Women grand final. Connors had been on the park for all of 120 seconds to that point, brought on to replace Princess Ibini. Now she was being mobbed by teammates converging from the pitch and the bench, having put her side on the way to a historic fifth title.
Goals win games, but in this case it feels more accurate to attach that honour to the pass that secured the winning strike. Collecting the ball as her side looked to break, Indiana dos Santos carried over the halfway line before dropping the ball into an area where only Connors could reach it. It sat up perfectly for her to shoot the first time. It was the type of ball attackers go to bed dreaming about, with Melbourne defender Taylor Otto able do little more than join the 7671 supporters in attendance in watching Connors deposit the ball beyond a charging Melissa Barbieri and into the back of the net.
Half an hour later, after ten tortuous minutes of added time, it was official. The Harboursiders stood alone. Alone not just as the champions of the A-League Women for the 2023-24 campaign but in the annals of the game’s history. “When we got ahead one-nil I knew we weren’t losing,” said Sydney boss Ante Juric. “It wasn’t pretty and it wasn’t how I wanted it to perfectly pan out, because we weren’t at our best. But in terms of heart we were through the roof.” As long as football has been played in this country – in the A-League Women or its predecessor Women’s National Soccer League – no side had ever won five titles until Saturday evening. No side, in fact, had won more than three, apart from City and Sydney. But Sydney now has five. They have back-to-back titles, after playing their seventh-straight decider, in their 16th straight finals campaign. City undoubtedly will have left AAMI Park feeling that they created enough and did enough to merit winning the game themselves. They finished with 14 shots to six, ten of which came in Jada Whyman’s penalty area. But the foibles that have threatened to derail this City side throughout the season, all of the ball but nothing to show for it, reared their heads again at the worst possible time.
True to his pre-game word, City boss Dario Vidošić sent his side out looking to win their their way. As they had done all season, City would seek to dominate possession and refuse to settle for half-chances. They would prevent their opponents from finding any semblance of rhythm or momentum with this weight of territory and possession – after all, you can’t score if you don’t have the ball. But while City would have their moments, and duly ended the game with 71% of possession, it felt like Sydney had come to AAMI Park knowing this was exactly what awaited them. City had come to win their way but Sydney had come to beat City, with plans in place to do just that. When City did get the ball into the final third, they all too often found themselves bogged down on the edge of the penalty area, knocking the ball around looking for the perfect pass or look on goal that a scrambling, physical, dogged defence refused to provide. Connors’ goal injected a new sense of urgency into their game, with Shay Holman miraculously deflecting a Letecia McKenna effort away and Rhiana Policina putting a hot shot over in the exchanges that followed, but there was to be no miraculous comeback. It didn’t result in a grand final that will go down as being particularly momentous for the on-field action – Juric called it “ugly” post-game – but Sydney came to Melbourne knowing what they needed to do. And while not everything worked, enough – especially defensively – did. In the end, they only needed one chance. And Connors was able to convert. “For 99 minutes we were perfect,” said Vidošić. “And then for that one second, we gave the ball away. A little bit sloppy, got caught, a little miscommunication at the back and [Connors] was able to put a chance away.”",,2024-05-04 08:57:11+00:00,Football,https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/may/04/shea-connors-late-strike-clinches-sydney-fc-a-record-fifth-a-league-women-championship,The Guardian
252, ,"A few weeks ago AFC Wimbledon Under-18s won 4-3 at Cheltenham Town in the Youth Alliance Cup. The visitors went 3-0 down but did not panic, tweaking tactics and adjusting systems before storming back. It was a wild contest, a remarkable turnaround, but what was even more impressive was Wimbledon were in effect managerless for the day, with the game designated as one of their player-led matches, a pioneering concept at the heart of their academy programme. Apart from booking the team bus to Gloucestershire, the onus was on the youngsters to organise everything and cope with the challenges: absorb the pressure, problem-solve on the spot and play. It is an idea that hands the initiative to players and one Wimbledon do a few times a season from the under-nines to under-18s. Safeguarding rules differ between age groups but a physiotherapist is always present, as legally required. “When you see 10-year-olds trying to dissect the game, looking at formations, telling people what position they are going to play in, it is empowering,” says their academy manager, Michael Hamilton, who has been asked to share the concept at Premier League and Football Association conferences. “Life is not easy. There are going to be ups and downs. You might get released when you think you shouldn’t, you might not get a run of games. It is about having a bag of tools you can go into and say: ‘What do I need today?’” The first time they put the idea into practice, the team bus took a wrong turn and the under-18s’ arrival at Leyton Orient was delayed. The group reassigned pre-match jobs to a handful of players who had made their own way to east London. That was in 2018-19 when Jack Rudoni, now of Huddersfield, was among the scholars and Mark Robinson, appointed head coach of Chelsea’s under-21s two years ago, was academy manager.
“In the debrief the boys admitted they would have seen the problem, known we were running late, but would have done nothing about it if the coaches were also on the bus,” Hamilton says. “Part of the outcome was: ‘Well, what if every day you come in and are as forward-thinking and attentive as you showed then? What can we achieve together?’” This is UK Coaching Week and the work of the League Two club is a fine example of the chosen theme: holistic development. In another exercise, designed to ensure youngsters have an appreciation of the work behind the scenes while hammering home the value of teamwork, the under-18s are asked to sleep on blow-up beds at the training ground from Monday to Friday. It means there is scope for triple sessions and for them to prepare sessions, and afterwards socialise in mobile phone-free zones. “We always say that if you don’t want to talk, socialise or be a good team player, go and be a tennis or snooker player, because football is a team game,” Hamilton says. “A lot of the characteristics we try to develop are transferable.”
This time of the year clubs announce their retained lists – detailing which players will be released – and academies are no different. Some of those tough conversations have taken place in recent weeks; for others the decisions are yet to be rubber-stamped. Latest figures from the EFL covering 2022-23 show 32% of academy players receive a scholarship, of whom 17% go on to earn a professional contract and 10% make a league appearance. “It was always a really emotional time because you knew you were delivering some great news and news that was going to be really hard to take,” Robinson says. “One of the analogies we would use was: ‘Imagine you’re going for an interview for a job and you open the door and there’s 1,000 people there.’ Three times a year we’d meet the parents and the big thing was to never get carried away, never make silly promises: ‘You’re going to be this sort of player.’ Always just say it how it is, what they’re doing well, what they need to work on.”
The club take pride in the duty of care they provide for players. Jack Currie has established himself as a fixture in the first team since stepping up from the academy, which he joined at 11. Others are across the world: Josef Bursik in Belgium with Club Brugge, Tyler Burey in Denmark with Odense and Ayoub Assal in Qatar with Al-Wakrah. Staff take equal pride in those who have found their feet outside the game since being released, including Nathan Gordon, a PE teacher and technique coach, and Jay Kalama, who works for Nike in sports marketing. Hamilton cites George Marchant, who halfway into his scholarship cancelled his apprenticeship to study engineering in the US. “The year before we signed papers to put him on the route to a professional contract,” Hamilton says. “That didn’t happen but it wasn’t failure, it was success. That was our-self managing aspect coming to life: a young man taking ownership of his life. We have a bigger responsibility than trying to make sure that at the age of 20, 21, boys are rolling out of the academy as professional footballers.” Wimbledon’s academy is underpinned by four values: hard work, attachment, memories and self-management, the last of which is perhaps most significant. Hamilton references the thinking of the former England rugby union coach Eddie Jones, who wanted to make himself in effect redundant by allowing players to take control. “We feel the more the boys need us to get through a game, then we’ve not executed what we planned,” Hamilton says. “We reference combat sports a lot, boxing and MMA fighters: ‘Once you close the cage it’s just you.’ Your coach can influence but it is you that has to commit to decisions and action the plan.” It is a sentiment shared by Robinson, who spent 18 years at AFC Wimbledon, including a 14-month stint in charge of the first team. “Everyone’s different,” Robinson says, “but if you ask me: ‘What does my perfect game look like?’. It is me standing on the line saying nothing while the team perform brilliantly making their own decisions because I believe that is what real education looks like. I don’t think it is pointing and telling and shouting. People say stupid things like: ‘You’re putting yourself out of a job.’ But if you look at what coaching is, it is to change the player’s behaviour, to improve or inspire their performance. It is not to teach them how to play 3-5-2.”",,2024-05-04 07:00:36+00:00,Football,https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/may/04/fc-wimbledon-player-led-matches-academy,The Guardian
253,,"The noise from the middle tier of the stand at the Spartak Stadium was strangely persistent, rising above the pre-match hum of Argentina versus Iceland in Moscow, the pitch a humid pocket of shade, the far end still pounded by heavy mid-afternoon sun. It was a banging noise. And a rattling noise. And a yelling noise. People had already begun to turn and point. Looking up, the first thing you saw from below was the fold of chins and sub-chins. Then it was the cigar, protruding like a gun snub above the lip of the balcony. And finally it was the face of Diego Maradona craning over the rail, arms spread in a papal gesture, and looking like, if not the most excited man of all time, then surely the most excited man yet.
It would be incorrect to say Maradona continued to have a really great time across the entire 90 minutes. He definitely took some breaks. The key moment, for this awe-struck hack, came at the end of the game. Hurrying inside, I passed him on the stairs. At first it looked like Maradona was slumped, but this was more a resting than a slumping. Someone had just clanged through the door next to him. In that moment it was me and El Diego alone in a stairwell. I loved Diego Maradona. I think love is appropriate here. With Maradona it felt personal. From the first time you saw him, you just knew you’d have to follow every single thing he ever did, that every sports person, athlete, performer would now be measured against the ideal of that grainy, gliding figure in the hard white light of Mexico 86, moving through the matrix of mortal human World Cup footballers like a superhero, bending the day, the game, the physics of it all to his will. There was no question in that moment of talking to Maradona. Instead, as it became clear this would be inevitable, given the need to walk up the stairs, I smelled Maradona. What did he smell of? Sweat. Chemical cosmetic product. And a generalised smell I can only describe as “man”. Maradona smelt of man. To be clear, I didn’t choose to smell Maradona. But I did let it happen, allowing the airborne Diego molecules to enter my nostril. To this day I am convinced some tiny sub-particle of me is still made up of Maradona molecules. Just as by reading this paragraph some part of your own brain, the valve that dissolves written thought-words into the lateral think-puddle (this is science) is also Maradona smell. So good luck with that and you’re welcome. It would become a familiar spectacle over the next 10 days. Maradona was at the World Cup on a $10,000-per-day Fifa legend junket. His appearances were often upsetting and uncontrolled. He was treated by paramedics at half-time in the Nigeria game for something he dismissed as “neck strain”. He seemed hyper-Diego. He looked like a man trying very hard to be present; or indeed on his way to somewhere else. Maradona died a year and half later aged 60. The reason for coming back to him now is that while his life was always difficult, his afterlife has become a horror story. Maradona has been worshipped, demonised and mourned. Right now he’s being litigated. The tax, inheritance and intellectual property wrangles continue to circle. And this week there was another startling twist in the ongoing desecration of Maradona’s death. The more sensational headlines have suggested his demise has been “linked to cocaine”. This isn’t strictly true. There has already been a major inquiry into his death by a 20-person panel. In 2021 this concluded that his medical team had acted in a “reckless” way, something they all deny. In April last year it was announced that Maradona’s doctor, Maradona’s neurosurgeon, Maradona’s psychiatrist, Maradona’s psychologist , Maradona’s home help, Maradona’s care co-ordinator and Maradona’s two chief nurses would go on trial for an offence that translates as “simple homicide” over their actions during his extended endgame, with a possible 25-year sentence if convicted. The trial is due to begin in June. Maradona’s neurosurgeon, Leopoldo Luque, has now commissioned a separate medical review. According to this report, made public this week, Maradona’s pre-death erratic heartbeat may have originated in an “external” source, with the implication, several leaps of logic later, that some unidentified party gave him cocaine while he was lying in what would become his death bed. The prosecutors have already dismissed this conclusion. Dr Luque, who was filmed announcing tearfully shortly after his death: “If I’m responsible for anything with Diego it was loving him,” has been captured in leaked WhatsApp messages from around the same time telling a business partner: “The fat man’s going to end up kicking the bucket.” And yes, this is all horrendous, unsurprising and entirely consistent with Maradona’s life, from the impoverished childhood to the buffetings of his career, to the current restless spirit, a body no one seems to want to lay to rest.
It is a body you feel you know intimately just from seeing the clips so many times, that way of walking and turning and jumping, the divine intelligence of his feet. It is also a body that was constantly marked, from the Andoni Goikoetxea tackle that broke Maradona’s ankle “with a sound like wood snapping”, to the endlessly injected knees, the narcotic abuse, the bouts of illness. Not to mention the record 53 fouls at a single (triumphant) World Cup. These were not fouls you “win” or “draw” but shin-gougers and leg-rakers. It is in part why Maradona will remain the most thrilling footballer you could hope to see. To be this good in this way, to play like some superhuman matador, out there making the game up off the cuff, always moving through his own lighter air, was also an act of physical bravery, a constant high-wire act. This was not a time when star players could expect to score 40 goals and win the league every year, stewarded by sports science and sympathetic refereeing. It was necessary to ration your strength, to seize the right moments. Mexico 86 was the reward for Maradona. It would also take him into the strangest of places, and on now into this final chapter of blame and neglect. Maradona was awful in Russia. He did all the wrong things. But perhaps the most galling part was a sniffy public statement from Fifa urging guests to behave “in a respectful manner” – presumably while occupying its own playboy stage constructed for the greater glory of Gianni Infantino’s great friend Vladimir Putin. What Maradona really needed was protection, for his sport to look after him; not to be lionised or left to the energies that would steadily chase him down. That body was crammed full of painkilling drugs when it finally winked out, then paraded through Buenos Aires before three days of public mourning. Maradona’s post-death will remain for now a toxic sideshow, his life an indictment of a sport that is always hungry, always leaping up in its box to feed the spectacle, but which retains the hardest of edges.",,2024-05-04 07:00:34+00:00,Football,https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/may/04/diego-maradonas-toxic-post-death-consistent-chaotic-life-career,The Guardian
254,,"Rob Edwards refused to wave the white flag after Luton missed the chance to move out of the bottom three of the Premier League with two games remaining. Although Edwards did not hide his disappointment about his side drawing 1-1 with Everton at Kenilworth Road on Friday night, the Luton manager insisted that they will not let up in their quest to stay up. Luton have drawn level on points with Nottingham Forest, who remain in 17th place thanks to their superior goal difference, and all is not lost yet. The mood could shift if Forest fail to win at Sheffield United on Saturday afternoon. “We wanted a win,” Edwards said. “We threw everything at it. We tried. We were the team pushing right until the end.
“In the end a draw wasn’t what we wanted. I’m proud of the players, the club, the supporters. They stayed with us until the end. We tried to do all the right things. We’re still in the mix. “On another day we could have won the game but we didn’t. We’ve got to keep going. We don’t have a crystal ball. It might be four points, five, six. It might be enough. We’ve got to believe it is. We go again.” Luton, who earned a point thanks to Elijah Adebayo cancelling out Dominic Calvert-Lewin’s opener, trailed after Teden Mengi gave away a penalty for a clumsy foul on Jarrad Branthwaite. “We don’t have too many complaints,” Edwards said. “Teden is going to have a fantastic career. It’s a learning experience for him. He held him for a bit too long.” Edwards joked that he would “just go into a dark room and rock in a corner” while Forest are playing at Bramall Lane. “The boys are a little bit flat in there but we’ll see what happens tomorrow,” Adebayo said. “We’ll do what we have to do. The boys have everything, pushed them back and made them defend. We’ll see how it goes.” Sean Dyche was aggrieved that Everton were not awarded another penalty for Mengi’s early challenge on Dwight McNeil. “I know there’s a lot of news and noise recently about penalties, but I’m amazed we didn’t have another one,” Everton’s manager said. “I’ve seen it back and his foot has clearly gone on top of Dwight’s foot. That one, from the penalties I’ve seen this season, I’m very surprised they’ve not given that.”",,2024-05-03 22:30:01+00:00,Football,https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/may/03/disappointed-rob-edwards-not-giving-up-on-lutons-survival-bid,The Guardian

258,Here’s Jacob Steinberg’s match report from Kenilworth Road:,"Here’s Jacob Steinberg’s match report from Kenilworth Road: Every point counts, but this one is unlikely to be enough for Luton Town. When the story of the 2023-24 Premier League season comes to be told, it is likely that they will look back with regret when they remember the night when they failed to find a way past a negative, limited Everton side. Of course, nobody inside Kenilworth Road could quibble with the level of Luton’s spirit and desire. There was also a lovely equalising goal from Elijah Adebayo, whose strike cancelled out Dominic Calvert-Lewin’s early opener, and there were periods when Rob Edwards’s team looked capable of breaking Everton down. The pressure was relentless during the second half. Tahith Chong, who never stopped running, was outstanding. Yet the awkward fact facing Luton is that this failure to beat Everton, whose safety is already assured, makes it one win from 15 games and meant they missed a chance to go out of the bottom three. They are level on points with Nottingham Forest, who have a superior goal difference, but it is hard to see a way out. Forest can go three points clear when they visit Sheffield United.

275,,"“In my heart and in my soul … this is what I am hoping for, yes,” Mikel Arteta says, as he prepares to go through the routine once again. It will be for the third time in the past fortnight or so and yet it is a movie the Arsenal manager has seen on countless occasions over the years – from a role on both sides, which only adds to the drama; the fear factor, too, which he must surely fight. Arteta’s team play first on Saturday as the Premier League title race nears its climax – at home to Bournemouth at 12.30pm. And then the defending champions, Manchester City, will have to respond when they host Wolves at 5.30pm.
It was a similar story around Arsenal’s previous two fixtures – the wins over Chelsea and Tottenham. City played after, beating Brighton and Forest. It is fun to imagine how Arteta lived those City matches, watching from afar, unable to influence anything; high from Arsenal’s results, then low when City punched back. As they have always done under Pep Guardiola. Arteta’s focus remains on ensuring that his players get their job done and, ideally, in less breathless fashion than the 3-2 win over Bournemouth in the corresponding fixture last season. That was in early March when they came back from a 2-0 deficit after the hour to win with a 97th-minute Reiss Nelson goal. And then who knows? Arteta will urge Wolves towards a result which would give Arsenal control of their title-winning destiny. “You know what is going on [with my emotions],” Arteta says, when asked how it has been to watch City. “You just want to win [the title] and to win you need others to drop points and you are hoping for that to happen. And then [after City win] you have to manage your emotion because there are still a lot of games and points to play for. You are going to have to perform, prepare and win the next match in order to maintain that momentum.” Arsenal need only one slip from City for the door to be prised ajar and yet the truth is that when Guardiola has had the title within his grasp at City – even with a long run to it and zero margin for error – he has never let it go, winning in five of the past six seasons. A good example came in 2018-19 when Arteta was his assistant and City won their last 14 games to take the trophy by a point ahead of Liverpool.
“As well we expect [that],” Arteta says. “When you look at what they have done in the last seven, eight years and the amount of points you have to have [to compete with them]; those sequences and those kinds of momentums to reach that amount of points. So it’s not a surprise.” If it is the hope that kills, it also inspires and Arteta wants to remind everyone, not least his players, about the progress they have made. Why was there no mention, he wondered, after Sunday’s win at Spurs of how Arsenal had secured a second successive Champions League qualification via league position? That had felt a long way away when they trailed in fifth behind Spurs in 2021-22. The answer, of course, is they now have loftier goals. Arteta, who reported that he had a fully fit squad, with Jurriën Timber available again after nine months out with damage to an ACL, talked about wanting to get much better; how he would love to build a dynasty of success. First and exclusively, though, it is beating Bournemouth. “There’s always room for improvement but I think the team is more mature,” Arteta says. “The health of the squad is in a much better position. All these factors contribute to being in a better position.”",,2024-05-03 21:30:22+00:00,Football,https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/may/03/arsenal-mikel-arteta-premier-league-bournemouth-manchester-city,The Guardian
276,,"Pep Guardiola has backed Phil Foden to become a Manchester City great and said the forward can help drive England to become European champions this summer, provided Gareth Southgate’s team believe they can win the tournament. On Friday Foden was announced as the Football Writers’ Association Footballer of the Year, recognition of a career-best season in which he has scored 24 goals for City and made 10 assists. The 23-year-old has claimed five Premier League titles, two FA Cups, four League Cups, one Champions League, one Uefa Super Cup and one Fifa Club World Cup. Guardiola was asked whether Foden could become City’s greatest-ever player.
“I don’t know – this club has a long, long history,” the manager said. “So you can’t forget what happened with the players who played at Maine Road, like everyone knows. If he continues his career until the end here and at [the same] level he can be one of the best, for sure.” England are among the favourites for Euro 2024 in Germany and Guardiola was asked to assess the attack, of which Foden is a part. “Really good,” he said. “But it’s not the talent of the strikers, it’s the whole package, and Gareth knows perfectly what he has to do. So I have the feeling, everyone has, that the England national team [in] the last World Cup and European championships make steps. “I see the reaction when they play European cups or World Cups – people go crazy in the streets, I love it. They go crazy for the national team; that proves how proud they are. As a football player that is the best.” If England believe in their strengths, Guardiola is sure they will win the tournament, comparing this to City’s Champions League triumph last season.
He said: “They are on the verge, they are really close; lost a final, got to a semi-final. When you arrive at these stages every two years, it’s going to happen. It’s quite similar to us: we were close and in the end we lifted it. Just believe it. If they believe it they can do it.” City host Wolves on Saturday knowing if they win their last four games a record fourth consecutive title will be claimed. Guardiola said that even if they lose all four he would still love his players. “We can lose all four games and that means I don’t trust my players? It’s impossible. I see them, I saw them, I still feel what they are doing. There’s no chance [of not trusting them]. It’s not about winning or losing that will change my opinion about this season in terms of what they have done. I love them so much.”",,2024-05-03 21:30:22+00:00,Football,https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/may/03/pep-guardiola-says-phil-foden-can-become-a-manchester-city-great,The Guardian
277,,"When the final story of the 2023-24 Premier League season comes to be told, it is likely that Luton Town will feel nothing but regret about the night when they ran out of inspiration and time against opponents as negative and rudimentary as Sean Dyche’s Everton. Of course, nobody inside Kenilworth Road could question Luton’s determination to fight until the end. There was a lovely equalising goal from Elijah Adebayo, whose strike cancelled out Dominic Calvert-Lewin’s early penalty, and there was no shortage of endeavour. Tahith Chong, who never stopped running, was outstanding and Luton would come agonisingly close to snatching the win that would have moved them out of the bottom three before Nottingham Forest visit Sheffield United on Saturday afternoon, only for Luke Berry and Andros Townsend to spurn three inviting chances during six added minutes.
The frustration built, particularly when Tim Robinson blew for full time before Luton could take one last corner. Ultimately, though, there was no point raging at the referee’s timekeeping. For Luton, it is hard to look beyond a run of one win in 15 league games. It is the worst run in the league and, for all their defiance, the harsh reality for Rob Edwards is that this 1-1 draw with Everton is unlikely to be enough to stop them from dropping back into the Championship. This has to go down as a missed opportunity for Luton, who will probably need to take maximum points off Fulham and West Ham in their final two games. Although this point drew them level with Forest, who have the cushion of a vastly superior goal difference, there was no hiding their disappointment. “Flat,” was how Adebayo described the mood in the dressing room, while Edwards spoke in rueful tones. The manager knew his side’s naivety had hurt them again. Luton, who have conceded 78 goals in 36 games, had made life difficult for themselves when Teden Mengi’s needless foul on Jarrad Branthwaite gifted Calvert-Lewin the chance to give Everton the lead from the spot. Their safety already secured, Everton’s nous drowned out the noise. Ashley Young, making the 450th appearance of his club career, shrugged off the taunts about his Watford past. Dwight McNeil laughed when he was abused for appealing for a penalty after tangling with Mengi on the left. Mengi was nervous during the first half, almost scoring an own goal when he stretched to clear a cross from McNeil, and he was punished in the 24th minute. A corner came in from the left and David Coote, the VAR, spotted the defender wrapping his arms around Branthwaite.
Did it matter that both players were nowhere near the ball? Not to the officials. Robinson checked the pitchside monitor and awarded a penalty. Ultimately, whatever the complaints about the cold influence of VAR, the defending was poor. Calvert-Lewin made Luton pay by beating Thomas Kaminski from 12 yards. There had to be a response. The crowd remained defiant and Luton upped the intensity in the 31st minute. Alfie Doughty made his presence felt, retrieving possession on the left, and the ball ran to Albert Sambi Lokonga. The midfielder lifted his head, looked right and spotted Adebayo peeling to the right. Away from Branthwaite and James Tarkowski, Adebayo was able to dominate Young in the air. The striker towered over the left-back, shrugging him to the turf. Young’s complaints were to no avail. How Luton missed Adebayo during his long spell on the sidelines. How they celebrated when he brought the ball down and lashed it past Jordan Pickford. It was Everton’s turn to creak. Beaten 6-0 by Chelsea in their previous away game, they were fortunate not to be behind at half-time, escaping when Ben Godfrey cleared Carlton Morris’s header off the line.
The pressure continued at the start of the second half, Chong causing problems. James Garner and Idrissa Gueye were both booked for fouling the midfielder. Sean Dyche brought on Amadou Onana and André Gomes. Everton knuckled down. No opportunity to drain Luton’s momentum with a bit of time-wasting was knowingly turned down. As the hour approached, Luton had still to create a clear opening since the restart. They were desperate for Ross Barkley to inspire them against his boyhood club. The game felt too broken, too rushed, too bitty. Tarkowski and Branthwaite won a lot in the air. Jack Harrison stopped Doughty going through on the left. Eventually Everton stirred, Harrison and Calvert-Lewin drawing fine saves from Kaminski. Luton were running out of steam. But somehow, powered on by Edwards’s substitutions, they geared up for one last push. Berry had a header saved by Pickford and an overhead kick deflected wide. A loose ball reached Townsend, whose shot was blocked by Branthwaite. Everton were resilient. The clock was always against Luton.",,2024-05-03 21:10:20+00:00,Football,https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/may/03/elijah-adebayo-strikes-but-frustrated-luton-fail-to-put-everton-away,The Guardian
278,,"In Ipswich the businesses are decking their premises in blue and white while passers-by wish the hours away. Banners, flags, good-luck messages and the nervous thrill of an underlying hubbub: there is only one topic of conversation in the shops and cafes of the modest, compact town centre. Football has always sat at the heart of this proud, often understated community: it comes alive beyond recognition when things are going well. There has been little to sustain it in the past two decades but now its pulse is beating faster than at any point in memory. If Ipswich Town secure a point or more against Huddersfield on Saturday lunchtime, their return to the Premier League will be confirmed. It is a prize that many in these parts, during darker moments, had given up hope of grasping again. They can earn it in front of a packed house at Portman Road, which remains one of English football’s most distinctive venues and has hit fever pitch over the past year. The continuation of a stunning season’s form would mean it is hosting some of the best players in the world a few months from now.
A giant image of Sir Bobby Robson gazes down from the stadium’s north-east corner. Robson and Sir Alf Ramsey, both immortalised in bronze a matter of yards away, made Ipswich an internationally known name in the second half of the last century. If this year’s vintage get over the line there may be calls for a third manager’s likeness to join them. Kieran McKenna has performed a miracle in guiding Ipswich from League One, where they had lingered for four years, straight to the sharp end of a brutal Championship promotion fight. There appears little doubt that the 37-year-old McKenna, who swapped an assistant role at Manchester United for East Anglia in December 2021, is destined for great things. Ipswich’s majority owner, the US group Gamechanger 20, wants the same for a club that has risen from what seemed a terminal slumber. Since relegation from the top flight in 2002 they have, after a couple of attempts at a quick comeback, rarely looked likely to trouble the elite. A club that used to innovate, whether with top-quality foreign talent such as Frans Thijssen and Arnold Muhren or by producing a steady stream of academy talent in the 1990s, became poor relations in a sport that simply left it behind. All that has changed since the Americans’ takeover three years ago but their rise is no triumph of money over method. While Ipswich were generously backed by third-tier standards they have had to battle the odds a division higher. Barely any outsiders expected them to last the course in an automatic promotion race against Leicester, Leeds United and until recently Southampton, all of whom could fuel their campaigns with Premier League resources.
“We’ve travelled a long way,” reflected McKenna in a characteristically measured, collected press conference on Friday. “The jumps have probably been harder than they’ve looked from the outside. It’s not been easy and it’s taken a lot of work.” Ipswich went up with 98 points last season and have 93 going into the final day this time; they have lost 10 times in 91 league games. Nobody attains numbers like these by luck and the overriding feature is McKenna’s ability to coax new levels from a tight-knit core of players rather than simply seek upgrades. Sam Morsy, the Ipswich captain, had been a respected Championship midfielder when Middlesbrough let him drop down to League One in 2021. When McKenna’s predecessor Paul Cook, who had persuaded him to rekindle a relationship that had thrived at Wigan, was sacked three months later he might justifiably have feared decline setting in. Now, at 32, he has become one of the division’s dominant all-rounders: a driving force with ox-like strength and the ability to set many of Ipswich’s intricate passing moves in train. “We’ve had lads being written off while at the club, lads written off last season, this season, and everyone has slowly improved and got better,” Morsy said before his manager took the floor. “To get to a good place it’s about improving every day, working every day, it’s setbacks. That’s what the journey looks like, it’s never straightforward. So I’m really proud of the players.”
Morsy leads a side that includes the cultured locally born defender Luke Woolfenden, who had been out in the cold under Cook. There are players like the rapid winger Wes Burns and the diminutive, johnny-on-the-spot No 10 Conor Chaplin, who have both answered any doubts about their ability to compete at the top of England’s most cut-throat league. The centre-back Cameron Burgess took time to become a first-choice pick after joining from Accrington Stanley but has become immovable and markedly more confident in possession. The 33-year-old Vaclav Hladky, who did not start a game in 2022-23 but now stands almost peerless among ball-playing goalkeepers, has enjoyed the most eye-catching ascent of all. If Ipswich do have a star it is the attacking left-back Leif Davis, who has turned heads across Europe with 18 assists. Ipswich will probably be able to bankroll another tilt at promotion with any fee received for Davis in the event they fall short this time, such is his range of admirers. At this moment more than any other, Leeds supporters may be wondering exactly who signed off the deal for just over £1m that brought him from Elland Road in July 2022. When Ipswich have paid fees under McKenna it has invariably borne fruit. They have also played the loan market adroitly: the 20-year-old Omari Hutchinson looked callow when he arrived from Chelsea last summer but, after flickering promisingly before Christmas, has exploded into one of the division’s best and most relentless attackers. His two long-range efforts in last weekend’s draw at Hull helped set a platform that was built upon on Tuesday night, when a 2-1 victory over Coventry brought them to within inches of the line amid delirious scenes among the travelling support.
Now the job has to be finished. Under McKenna, Ipswich have been performance-driven and the stated aim for this season was simply to do as well as they could. Nobody at their training facility has accepted offers to look further than Saturday’s kick-off. “You could get into that and: ‘Wow, if I’d be a Premier League player and playing against Manchester City, and if I do that, that, and that,’” Morsy said. “But come Saturday you’d have no energy. I’m experienced enough to realise that.” It is a message Morsy and McKenna will preach to the last. Barring an implausible 15-goal swing Huddersfield will be relegated at full time and their manager, André Breitenreiter, has not hidden his displeasure at some of his players’ efforts. The Terriers’ camp is not a happy one but Ipswich had to squeeze a late draw in the reverse fixture and their open style usually gives opponents a chance. There are enough slithers to give Leeds, who must beat Southampton to retain any hope of the top two, encouragement that nothing is over.
As before last season’s promotion clincher against Exeter, which may prove a mere dress rehearsal, thousands of Ipswich fans will cram surrounding streets and roar the team coach into the ground at 11am. “Of course there’ll be a special atmosphere,” McKenna said. “We know there’ll be a full stadium, people outside the stadium. They’ll be behind us and try to push us. We’ll try to use that.” Even if things go wrong, and again they face a playoff campaign for which Ipswich would have to dig deeper than ever, the club can reflect on extraordinary progress. On Friday morning Mark Ashton, their indefatigable chief executive, visited Gusford primary school in the town’s south-western reaches: the sight that greeted him, an assembly packed full with cheering youngsters resplendent in their Ipswich shirts, would have been unthinkable three years ago. Colours of top Premier League clubs are now a rarity around town. A club whose decay lost a generation of supporters has learned from past mistakes and looks equipped for the future. The champagne is on ice and tales are rife of ticketless supporters who will jet back from places such as Melbourne, New York and Dubai to immerse themselves in the occasion. Maybe the celebrity fan Ed Sheeran, currently stateside, will be tempted to drop in between engagements. These are moments that strike so rarely over a lifetime, but McKenna wants everyone swept along on an even longer journey. “We want to make sure that, whatever happens at the end of the season, it’s no end point for Ipswich Town,” he said. Ipswich, so often a byword for old-world charm, are close to the cutting edge at last.",,2024-05-03 17:40:25+00:00,Football,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/article/2024/may/03/ipswichs-pulse-beats-faster-on-verge-of-ending-premier-league-exile,The Guardian

280,,"Sir Jim Ratcliffe has ordered Manchester United’s staff to raise standards after describing the level of untidiness in offices as a “disgrace” and some dressing rooms as “not much better”. Ratcliffe, the minority owner who now controls United’s football policy, made his comments after a two-day tour of Old Trafford and the Carrington training ground. He wrote: “I had a good tour around some of the facilities. I am afraid I was struck in many places by a high degree of untidiness. In particular the IT department, which frankly was a disgrace, and the dressing rooms of the U18 and U21 were not much better.” His remarks in an email to staff were sent on Friday afternoon. Ratcliffe then compares the standards with that of Ineos, the multibillion-pound company he owns. “These standards would not come close to what we would expect at Ineos and we are a chemical company. Manchester United is an elite sporting organisation. It’s a small thing in many ways but unless an organisation has standards and discipline it will not succeed. “I would be grateful in future if we adopt the proper standards of housekeeping everywhere. It reflects poorly on the club if we have visitors, young player parents, new players and the media and they see we don’t care enough to keep things shipshape.” Ratcliffe, who stated in the email he had been made to feel welcome by staff, is also assessing whether Erik ten Hag should remain as the manager beyond this season. Ten Hag is fighting to stay after a disappointing campaign that last month featured United allowing soft goals against Chelsea, Liverpool, Bournemouth and Coventry City. In an interview with Sky Sports Ten Hag, who could still win the FA Cup this season, explained why his team are not set up more defensively. “We thought about this, but one of my objectives here was to bring in a proactive way of play,” he said. “The [injured] players will return so if you then adjust, go in a very defensive style and it doesn’t fit to the players we already have, then if you don’t get the results everyone will lose confidence. Then when the players are back, you have to return to the proactive and you have lost many times.”",,2024-05-03 16:54:58+00:00,Football,https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/may/03/jim-ratcliffe-disgrace-manchester-united-facilities,The Guardian
